B008XDNMH4,A1J5J80ZS0NO5Q,"10 6, 2012",Bea,REALLY NOT a Good Book,"Wow,what a disappointment!  This was just about my least favorite read in a long time.  The plot was shallow, the characters trite and the sarcasm over the top.  In fact, it wasn't sarcasm: it was pages & pages of bad slapstick, insults and snide comments.When I read ""Death by Sarcasm"", it was a delight.  The dialogue was witty, the story well developed and the players descriptive.  The sarcasm left you laughing at the ""bite"" and added to the richness of the book.  With this book, the sarcastic dialogue attacked you immediately in the first pages and you're taken back by the brashness of it.  It just wasn't funny!  Mary is obnoxious, Alice is crude and the overall story is just meaningless.  The book was wrapped-up nice and neat in the end after Mary one-handedly tracked the killers, figured out the situation, rescued the missing woman and was reunited with her lover.  Yeah, right.This is a stupid book to me and I'm sorry I bought it.  It was a fast read because there was nothing substantial in the text.  I've enjoyed many books by this author, which is why I bought this one without downloading the sample.  Lesson learned:  always read the sample before you buy!",1

The lack of context was a real problem in getting into this story.  I understand that it was meant to be a bridge between books one and two in a series, but maybe a more detailed preface explaining who these people are or what sort of powers they have would help those of us who haven't read the first book.Instead, all we got was a preface explaining that Ren wasn't going to have a happy ending in this story - a rather unnecessary spoiler, I thought.Anyway, Ren is very jealous of his ex-girlfriend or ex-something's happiness (the nature of their relationship wasn't clear - I couldn't tell if they'd been having sex for the last hundred years or if they'd had sex once in a hundred years of unrequited love) so he goes to her house and has a threesome with her and her new boyfriend.

I believe that the author deserves just a bit of &#34;atta-boy&#34; for their effort. If this was not the case, I think this book would merit a 1/2 star. For me it was truly horrible and I couldn't finish it.At the beginning it looked like it was going to be an interesting read although a bit juvenile in dialog considering the ages of the main characters. Unfortunately, in less than half-way through I was ready to toss it. Finally, after another chapter or two, I did.The female &#34;lead&#34; in this story, if it can be called that, doesn't need a man . . . she needs a psychiatrist! And the central male character, supposedly in his late middle to early senior years, couldn't seem to get his mind away from sex. I guess he needed a psychiatrist as well. (not that older men aren't supposed to have an active libido)The &#34;Swear Jar&#34; made few appearances, but if it had of been the &#34;sex jar&#34; they would have been multi-millionaires. Once the central figures decided that they were interested in one another . . . let the sex begin, and begin, and begin! It was like a marathon and the story got lost in the sexual escapades. If it wasn't for the sex, there wouldn't be much left.I know this is beginning to sound like I am against sex -  not so, but when a story loses itself and becomes merely a prop for the sex, then it's not a story at all.The book was way too long and unless you prefer repeated (did I say repeated?) sexual escapades, there just wasn't enough story to hold any interest.Sorry, save your money and time.",1

I have never before encountered a story as depressing as this.  Or as confusing.  The author takes us back and forth between the real time story and the rambling thought processes of an eighteen year old high school student who is despised by almost everyone in town without delineating the beginning or end of either sequence.  The confusion is only compounded when you encounter the missing word or incorrect verb tense.

They make little sense, the characters are mainly on the dumb and mean side. High school girls are chopping people's heads off with alarming regularity - but guess what? They get their heads back. Most of the time. The main problem is that the books are repetitive as hell with an obnoxious, self-centered main character who instead of saving the people she pledged to help, drones on and on about her quasi-boyfriend's blue eyes. BO-ring. There are about 80 plot lines that go nowhere. Looming threats are undelivered upon, so who cares? Skyla is supposed to be the purest, strongest angel on earth, yet somehow she is continually overpowered and defeated while acting like an idiot. Her teen voice vacillates between insipid and overly verbose. Just annoying. Addison Moore has created a machine she can continue to capitalize on by dangling resolutions that never come.

It wasn't -- not even an episode with a cliffhanger.  It just runs for a few pages and stops in mid scene.It looks like the art work would probably be good, if I could see it better.  The pages (what few there are of them) insist on showing in landscape mode, not portrait.  Each page is three panels, and I can't tell but it sure looks like the top and bottom panels are cut off.Supposedly you can double-tap to zoom.  That worked sometimes, not others.  But even when it worked, I just got a blow-up of a small part of the screen, not necessarily where I double-tapped.  Why not show an enlargement of the panel that I tapped into?  That might be some use, but nooooooooo.I see other reviewers are blaming Amazon for this.  That's silly. The publisher, DC Comics, is responsible for formatting and pricing.  I can't tell for sure, but from the titles it looks like the actual story has been chopped into 36 of these little snippets -- at 99 cents a pop.  Almost $36 for a digital comic book?

But nothing is as it seems. Story itself is fantastical--a tale cribbed from Stephen King thriller meets Stepford Wives with a little Rosemary's Baby sprinkled in for seasoning. By the time I got to the end of the story, I felt duped.Technically, the writing is a dog's breakfast of poor sentence structure, garbled grammatical conundrums, and repetitious words. Matt Drabble seems to be writing in phonetic English: he uses ""would of"" when he should have written ""would've."" Other reviewers mentioned his use of: ""for all intensive purposes"" instead of  ""for all intents and purposes."" My ESL friend would dub Drabble's rabble as being functionally literate, and nothing more.Most irksome is that Drabble is so out of touch with the language across the pond, that he had American characters speaking in UK English idioms. I'm sorry, but we Yanks just don't say ""jumpers"" for sweaters (an idiom lost in translation), or ""torch"" for flashlight, or ""lorry"" for truck. It's one thing to have the narrator of the story speaking in British idioms, but the quoted dialogue of American characters should convey the language of the country it represents.I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this book is in need of serious editing, I don't think it was edited, ever. Another reviewer didn't mind the typos, because he liked the story. A third reviewer wrote: ""Who does the editing, keyboarding, punctuation, and proofing for these ebooks, anyway? I am tired of having to decipher text."" For those of us with dyslexia, those pesky typos and errors are not just distracting, they throw us out of the story.

I don't think so...,"This review is intended to cover the two stories in this series: ""Owned by the Navy Seal"" and ""Taken by the Navy Seal (Part 2) (Owned by the Navy Seal)"". I purchased them together, as the first story was $0.99 and the second story was a free download. The outlay being less than a dollar, I didn't think I could go too wrong.Well, I guess it says something when I note that I decided to return the 99c item and I've deleted the free one from my library.So, what actually managed to go wrong?1. I like my military men. Go through my reviews and you'll find plenty of hot, alpha, military guys scattered throughout. So, the Navy Seal angle was pretty much the headlining attraction for me in this story.  Imagine my surprise then, when the hero turns out to be in construction and has no connection to the military other than the briefest mention, at the beginning of the story, that he was a retired Navy Seal. That's it. No back story, no military buddies that he hangs with, no flashbacks...zilch. I have nothing against construction workers, but when a story is listed under 'Miltary Romances on Kindle', I have certain expectations that, in this case, weren't met.2. The first story is incredibly brief - no real harm done when you consider the second is free. However, even when you put both stories together, nothing really happens in the lives of the main characters. Well, other than a few heated couplings. If it was true erotica, that would be enough, I guess. But there's nothing erotic about what these two are up to. The sexual tension is virtually non-existent and the description of their horizontal activities is hardly inspiring. There is the odd use of words such as 'slurping' and apparently they experience sounds and moments of 'pure pleasure'. Whatever... Sommer Marsden, Cara McKenna this author is not.3. The overall writing is not technically terrible, but nor is it particularly engaging. There are a few grammatical errors - such as the incorrect use of the word, 'whom' - however, it's the lack of character development, the boring dialogue and the plot without any real direction that makes it a tiresome read.4. The real clincher (and probably why I've been a bit harsh) in all this, is the unnecessary (and, frankly, mystifying) swipe that this author takes at another author's work in the second novel. She has two characters discuss, at length, the erotic trilogy written by another writer and, in short, completely pans the work. It doesn't take too much imagination to figure out which trilogy she is flexing her claws at. And, given that other author has made millions and secured a lucrative movie deal, whereas Ms North couldn't even keep my 99c...well, enough said.Didn't like it, wouldn't recommend it.",1

It might have been due to the sheer number of characters involved in the story (many seemed to only be present to create the opportunity for more lack luster stories). Also, the relationship between the two main characters was completely unrealistic. He's 7 yrs older than her and runs multiple businesses. She's a shy 20 yr old college girl without a clue.

B009TW9WJU,A2KOR8DEDS4HZ3,"10 30, 2013",Bookie Nookie,Fell Short of Expectations :-(,"I was so excited when I read the summary for SPARKS. I really thought I was in for a wild story full of deception and corruption and hot sex, but I was sorely disappointed.Gabrielle Winston has created a financial analysis application that could corner the market and change the way businesses are run called Sparks. She shouldn&#8217;t have used her software for work-related business, but she did and now she can&#8217;t hide the impending financial doom that everyone will encounter from her bosses and the rest of the public. While uncovering this upcoming crisis, she also unravels the plots of enemies and creates a few enemies of her own. Now she must keep quiet and keep safe and hope the inner turmoil doesn&#8217;t ruin her. Jarin San Chapelle is a successful businessman and artist from a wealthy family with ties to Gabrielle&#8217;s company. He wants her application and he wants her too. He can have both if he can keep them safe.First, let me tell you Cathryn Louis is obviously one smart cookie. She is a self-proclaimed techie with the resume to back it up and you can see that there is no shortage of information in her writing. I&#8217;m not dumb, but most of the plot revolves around industry terms that those in the business know and it&#8217;s another language for those who don&#8217;t do this for a living, like me. So I ended up skimming a lot of material with detailed instructions on how Gabrielle does her analyst job. (Pages upon pages of information on corporate networks and financial analysis apps. Blah.) Luckily, I understand enough about the market crash to follow that part of the plot, but its not something I desire to read about in a novel in such extreme detail. Let me repeat, DETAIL. I would&#8217;ve stopped reading if not for the fact I was reading for review. The plot of corporate espionage and hostile takeovers during an impeding market crash could have been interesting, but its not well executed. I was bored and lost for the majority of book.That being said, I was also expecting romance. Where is the sexy time?? Gabrielle and Jarin don&#8217;t even meet until the second half of the story and then all of sudden - BAM! - they&#8217;re in love. Uh, what did I miss? It was so out of the blue it seemed that it may have been thrown in afterwards. Gabrielle hates Jarin for being a jackass then the next day he grabs her to say sorry and that&#8217;s their love story. I&#8217;m not exaggerating. That&#8217;s it. Stolen glances and possessive feelings are mixed into the remainder of the story to convey their relationship. Unbelievable and boring.Unless you&#8217;re an IT techie genius or an investment banker I would not read SPARKS. Even people with those specific backgrounds may not find this interesting, because who wants to read about work when you&#8217;re not at work? I read for entertainment and to escape real life and this book failed me on both counts.&#10035;&#10035; Copy provided by the author/publisher for an honest review.",1

It's true that it needs an editor but it needs an author too because it's so incredibly poorly written you won't believe it.The heroine is kidnapped but seems to accept her fate with no complaints. Her kids are taken away from their world -literally - but the heroine just shrugs and has sex with the alien hero. And the kids throw their arms around him within hours - he's a scary alien and they are on board his space ship. Any kid would be frightened, not loving their new ""stepdad"".I suspect the glowing reviews are because of the big, sexy (without knowing it) and lovable hero and the massive amounts of sex in this book. But the hero is a cartoon figure and the sex is just annoying. The heroine comes for no good reason at all - the hero even calls her out on her having an orgasm the first time they have sex so the next time, like the obedient little wife she is, she holds back her orgasm until he tells her it's fine if she comes too.The writing is incredibly bad and the author can't have read her own story before publishing. She definitely never paid an editor to look it through and correct mistakes but I suppose the author is laughing all the way to the bank with the money she saved.

I felt no compassion for the heroine and couldn't connect with either her or the hero in this book.  Other books with similar heroine's usually explain the reasons behind involvement in prostitution; in this book, she simply says she didn't have any other choice - that is just not good enough.She repeatedly refers to her striking beauty and confidence which no man can resist, yet (1) we get no description of her; and (2) she's insecure through half the book. I also hated how she contradicted herself in every other sentence.  e.g.""I had no idea where I was going, but I had an idea, and that was a start"" - I get this sentence, but it's just painful to read.Then she becomes obsessed with a guy whom she finds ""creepy"" through 2/3 of the book, then all of sudden they're both insanely in love even though they know nothing about each other.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.Sam Crescent is an author that I admire and enjoy. So it really grieves me to have to write a less than favorable review of her newest book, The Alpha Takes a Mate. I liked the general storyline and Ms. Crescent's writing flows easily. However, I felt no connection to either the hero or heroine and even preferred some of the secondary characters to Brandon and Elle.Brandon is the alpha werewolf of the Northern Forest Pack and alphas tend to be confident, take charge men. But there's confident bordering on arrogance, and then there's arrogant bordering on a##hole. Brandon definitely fit the latter. In fact, he is somewhat of a Neanderthal who doesn't believe that humans warrant much respect. Unfortunately he ends up with a human as a mate and from the moment he senses her, he ceases to be concerned about her thoughts and feelings. He has his pack mates grab her, he painfully bites her wrist to mark her, and then he drags out of the diner where she works and takes over her life. He might as well have clubbed Elle on the head.Elle is young, having only just turned 21. While she is aware of werewolves and the concept of mating, she seems immature and unaware of the customs of the shifters. She allows Brandon to take over her life, take her virtue and then lie to his pack and other paranormal beings. Elle is hurt and humiliated but she doesn't stand up to Brandon.There is also a side storyline in The Alpha Takes a Mate of a possible threat from Elle's past, but it is over so quickly and barely explained that it is easy to overlook. In addition, Brandon receives punishment from his pack for his lies about his mate but I did not find the punishment redeemed his character at all. At least for me it didn't. Finally, the sex scenes offered some heat, but without the emotional connection between the hero and heroine, the lovemaking just fell flat.The Alpha Takes a Mate just never lived up to it's potential. Ms. Crescent has many other great books that you should put on your to read list. I just wouldn't put The Alpha Takes a Mate on that list.",1

From the constant mis-spellings to the inconsistency concerning the time frames, to the not so original plot and the way it was executed through out equals-NOT INTERESTING, IRRITATING, & POINTLESS READ.The book starts out with a prologue in the present leading you into the past starting in May. Mom just died. Two weeks later its September, school has started and apparently they still have not had her mom's funeral *color me confused* then they are having the funeral in Sept (4 months later) but they are just meeting the funeral director. The next paragraph it turns into the actual funeral service then we're back in the ""present"" its October.. Then out of no where 7 months seems to have passed, we're in May. Next paragraph we're back in winter. Do you see how this back and forth time warp could really jack a person up trying to understand this story?And the characters are all over the place as well. Nothing deep about them. Maybe Adrian. I would say that he carried the book but for majority of the book his POV is practically non existent. And his history/journey you miss a great deal of. He's just seen as an over sexed emotionless spoiled jerk with no hope of redemption. Although you see a spark of this trying to come through but the flow of the story snuffs it out.Once you get through the pointless angst, you're headed for the Epilogue. Which is another inconsistent time warp cos it tells you 4 years after high school has passed when Adrian and Avena meet up again. Yet in the Prologue, when they are meeting up again in the present, before it takes you to how their story started, it tells you only 18 months have passed. So again, which is it?The only way this one can be a good read is if...1. This author withdrawls this version of this book from purchase and starts over.2. get an editor to help track inconsistencies & spelling3. Tell this story strictly from Adrian's POV, and expound more on his story. (It's the only thing interesting in this story which unfortunately, you don't get much of)4.If you're going to use Avena's mother's death as a means of explaining her broken spirit, then find a better & more consistent way of tying that into the overall arc of the story.This book just came off as super sloppy, no way of knowing how to find where it was truly wanting to go.I can't in good faith recommend this read. If you still would like to read it, I would strongly suggest borrowing and not buying it.",1

It might have been a formatting error but sentences and paragraphs would end in odd places. The POV would jump from one character to another and at times was very confusing.Now the story itself I fond was very uncomfortable at times. I thought that DL was very abusive as a DOM. There were also a few things in the story that never went answered. Like what happened to Lady Angle's son? I just had a hard time finding this book to be even remotely believable in anyway.I would have been very disappointed if I would have paid for this book.

Women are here to appease the sexual appetites of men with willingly and knowing they are not to expect anything in return except for being shown the door or the brush off. But these men are just so hot that these stupid heroines just keep coming back for more-- huh? What happened to writing stories with strong heroines that have confidence and self respect? That kick these man sluts to the curb. I'm so sick of these kinds of books. The heroine (i can't even remember her name) is stupid to put up with or even desire Cole in the first place.

She even hears his sexcapdes outside his dorm and when he finds her there after finishing his moaning and banging against the wall sex scene with another girl she just sits there moping and asking him if he'll try and change for her.

B0072X0AZ8,A9HKMI0ACLI43,"11 26, 2012",SallMallReads,Upset,"********SPOILERS*********Finally have the time to write a review. The story was so upsetting, I just couldn't wait to write everything down. It is rare that that I give a low rating of 1 to books and although this was not a horribly terrible story, I found some of the elements of the story to be so negative that no matter how many times I thought of the good things, the negative just took over.After reading all the positive reviews, I had a great urge to read it. I put it off a day or two since I knew it was going to be a tearjerker, which it somewhat was and I felt like reading a more heartwarming one at the time. And even though I knew what the ending was going to be, I couldn't stop myself from starting it earlier than I thought I would.I think some of the problem lies in the fact that a lot of the events and messages were simply contradictory. The first problem that I saw, which would have typically led me to stop reading the book if I had not felt such hope for the great ending, was the female character's handling of one her past relationships. There are cheaters and then there are the vicious. At one point, Maven even reveals that her ex-boyfriend had always had a bad temper since they were young, and we even see the violent side of him. Yet she had had a relationship with him despite being such a nice girl. That could be overlooked as bad judgment or a mistake since sometimes people fall for the wrong kind. However, she is so heartbroken over losing him that she admits that she would have taken him back. Completely did not make sense because even if we don't count that he cheated (an action I usually never overlook) on her, he was soo cruel about it. There was not even any reason for him to taunt Maven about having a new girlfriend. He was simply mean. He demeaned her constantly. Most cheaters just go on to have the new relationship, not ever looking back. Some might even apologize and beg to be taken back. However, Jake deliberately hurts her by throwing it in her face, making fun of her character. So it is not the fact that he cheated and Maven had considered taking him back, it's the fact that the cheating is the only thing she thinks about instead of recognizing how he is being cruel. How can you consider taking back a person who has a horrible, mean personality? And she's supposed to be a good girl?Now if we move on from this, as I decided to do because I was waiting for the very emotional ending, we discover that the amazing, noble Henri is not as selfless as he was shown to be throughout the whole book. He refuses to go on the donor list, which I found so inspiring and fell in love with his thinking. He wants to give someone else the chance to life, mostly someone much younger than him. HOWEVER, near the end, a very sorrowful scene takes place in the story, and I believe Henri's decision of how to deal with it was the main thing that gave me such a bad feeling after reading this. He wants to give someone else the chance to life, so he says he will not be selfish and will choose to die. But, I did find him to be selfish because he was too into proving that he has accepted his inevitable death and to show that everything is coming to an end, he does not speak up about who the perpetrator was of the brutal attack against him. He just found it easier to just move on and not worth dealing with. Even if the act could not be proven, by him speaking up, other people could have been warned of the vicious person out there. And although Maven and another character have an idea of who it was, they do not do anything about it again after that night. So while he's giving up a spot so one other person can have life, he's letting another person get away who could go on to kill a hundred others. No thanks. While being able to save one life is beautiful, how could you give another person a chance to take away so many others? Not only that, suppose Maven does not get the idea of who this perpetrator is, and goes on after Henri's gone, to allow that person into her life, how can he allow that to be a possibility? Even if he is not taking into account other people the perpetrator could hurt, how can you not at least think this scenario in relation to the person you claim to love?I just could not see the logic in the parts mentioned above. Give one person life on one hand and on the other, not prevent another person, who was basically an almost murderer, from hurting so many more? It was like leaving behind potential future victims.I know I repeated a lot of things in this review, but I just could not stop myself. Like I said, it was not terrible writing but the reasons given behind certain actions were just disappointing. This is a story that could have been at least a 4 star if it had been written a little differently. There was one other thing, unless I'm misunderstanding something, I think there were several times the word ""anymore"" was used completely wrong. At the moment I can't think of the word that should replace it or what other word might be missing from the phrases used with ""anymore"" to make them correct. But it was kind of annoying. The story is written in a way that we get glimpses of what a lot of the other characters are thinking. This was nice but a few times it was hard to tell when the switch between the character's point of view was made. Also, the two main characters are young but the story made them seem even younger and more childlike sometimes, not the adults or young adults that they were supposed to be portraying.So by the end, we do get our teary moment, but it did not leave me with the stronger combination of sadness and love as these stories are meant to do.Glad that is over.",1

Virtually everybody in the story has difficulty relating to others.  Conversations begin and then trail off without any important information being related.  The author doesn't prevent any ""normal"" interactions for us to be able to judge if the characters are the ones who have difficult understanding normal human interactions or if the problem actually is with him.  I had assumed that a main character was mentally unbalanced and waiting for that to develop throughout the story.  However, when the story ended, apparently he had become ""normal,"" making a very unfulfilling conclusion.  Why set up a ""weird"" situation for a short story with all this foreshadowing and then leave it unexplored and unexplained?  The only way the author can advance the story is to tell us -- in simple sentences -- what type of people the characters are (things like:  He was a nice person.  He liked people.  He didn't know why, that was just the way he was).  We're never shown anything through the action of the story.  People are just put in situations, have weird, trailing-off conversations, and then we're subjected to basic statements about the type of people that they are.The environment isn't very realistic either.  Because of some odd wording, I thought at first that maybe the story was set in another country -- but then a character mentions being from ""Michigan,"" which is the only sense of place we got in the story.  We know we're not in Michigan and we're in a city.  Don't hope for anything more specific.  It's a place where a independent office supply story is still in business (and can afford to pay ten dollars an hour for part time help) -- but is it in modern times?  Don't hope for anything specific, because it won't be happening.The characters seem not to know things that we would know.  For example, a character was in ""the war"" and has returned home and worked another type of job.  Later, ""old bruises"" on his face are thought by other characters to be from ""the war.""  However, human healing doesn't work that way and all humans should be aware of that.  Bruises, even ""old"" ones, have to be relatively recent and not from old trauma.The experience of reading this story is kind of like if another species was writing about humans and their interactions.  We know we don't act that way, but to a elephant, these interactions might make sense.The proofreading is better than some earlier reviews stated (I'm going to guess issues were corrected), but still not a professional job.",1

However, there were some things I found to be very objectionable, and my hope is the author can use the opinions in these customer reviews to hone her craft.***SPOILERS***The first part of the book was okay, though anyone who has any friends going through any type of recovery from addiction knows that the addict is encouraged to take personal responsibility for their actions.  For me, the main character was stuck in victimhood and blaming others for her fall from grace.  But the point where I put the book down in disgust was the same moment mentioned by another reviewer, though for a different reason.  The author saw fit to kill off the heroine's best friends; apparently she couldn't think of another way to provide conflict for the H/h to overcome.  What made my hair stand on end was the fact that the heroine, coming straight from an agreement to seriously pursue her relationship with the hero, then drives away without a word.  A few facts about the hero have already been established:  1. He always carries a blackberry with him, as he's non-verbal and it's his only way to communicate in real time.  Completely simple to have sent the guy a text.  Barring that, they're working at a hotel - leave a note at the desk, voice mail on his room phone, stick a Post-It to his door, for cripes' sake.  2. His loss of speech is due to severe trauma.  The heroine, a trained nurse, sees fit to disappear in this way from the life of someone who's already very delicately balanced?  It's not only deeply stupid, it's also unethical, and downright mean.

The grammar was so bad that I found myself having to re-read every other sentence just to keep up with the story.

There are so many things that this book failed at, that it is hard to figure out which one is the number 1 reason.I guess I'll start with the most glaringly obvious: Scarlett! This child (because let's face it, that's what she was) was the most annoyingly indecisive, narcissistic pain in the ass female lead character I've ever read. I was kind of going that she would be the one to be killed off, but no such luck. Scarlett was ALWAYS head-over-heals in love with someone (who that was depended on the page), if everything didn't go according to her plans, she ran away and made impulsive decisions that hurt most everyone around her. There was no communication between her and whomever she was currently meant to be with, unless one of them overhead something they weren't supposed to. Not to mention all things were resolved and subsequently decided by sex. She only really ever brought up her best friend when it was relevant to garner some sympathy, and if I had to read that she melted into a puddle after liking at one of the guys again, I was going to puke.Ash vs. Mason: not to give to much away, but it was quite apparent who the author wanted to end up with Scarlett from quite early on. With one, there was a ton of details regarding sex, and other time spent. With the other, not so much.The twist: wow, what a way to make that issue of Scarlett making a decision just disappear as quickly and uneventful as possible. I felt extremely cheated with that, and I want even fully on that team.Editing: dear God people it's called proofreading, look it up! Normally I can handle the occasional font mishap, spelling error, or missing word, but this was ridiculous! It actually made taking this book serious that much more difficult.This book definitely have of the impression that the author was just DONE. it kind of felt like the author really didn't have any original ideas for this series, therefore she read other authors and tried to emulate their stories without being ridiculously obvious.

B006IJWJWY,A15EL7I42ETNQX,"01 29, 2012",Rain Levity,One of the worst shifter novellas I've read,"I read the other reviews and thought maybe those reviewers were just people who weren't able to suspend disbelief for the typical shifter plot device of the mate connection.  I don't usually mind when two strangers meet, and there is a spark that ignites immediate lust and even protective feelings, and they get intimate before they are even introduced, etc.  The sample of this book made me think that this would be one of those, and although the single girl moved into her new apartment in a new state that day, and then let a big, hunky man into her apartment without checking that he was really a detective, and then had lusty unprotected sex with him right away, I was good with all that.  I can suspend disbelief and go with the flow, usually.  What turned me off and made me despise both the characters was the hero's lack of feelings outside of lust and ownership, and the heroine's lack of personality.  Basically, my only feelings towards these characters were of dislike (hero) and disgust (heroine).Synopsis with SPOILERS: After the first lusty encounter, during which he marked her without her knowledge, which could have been OK is handled correctly, the werecoyote just told the human woman, in whose apartment he was, and who he didn't know the first thing about other than that she was unmarried and apparently his mate, that she was ""his"" and that she would obey him.  The girl barely balked at that, and when she protested even a little, he didn't explain or feel anything for her, he just got angry and scared her more, threatening her physically.  He asked for an extra key, and she gave him her only one, then he left her with instructions not to leave her apartment because a killer would be after her if she did.  Nevermind he interrupted her dinner when he barged in and basically raped her, and he's a shifter so surely he knew there was no food in her new apartment.  Then when she went out to the nearest market for chips and a sandwich, he was waiting for her and actually drew her blood in his ire that she had disobeyed him!  By the way, this human woman (who never did get a physical description or any background whatsoever) accepted the existence of werewolves without any question, much less complaint, because she saw his fangs and claws come out.  I kept thinking ""Stockholm Syndrome, much?""  It gets worse when he kidnaps her and takes her to his compound, where she gets to know the other coyote women, I guess, though there is not really any description of anything or anyone.  She is worried that he doesn't love her... but there has been absolutely nothing between them but sex from the reader's perspective.  And he continues to be a cold fish with no feelings or sympathies.  There is little explanation of this other than that he is ""enforcer"".  In the end, the predictable happens:  He's off chasing the bad guy, who has come to the compound and kidnaps her and ties her up to have his way with her.  The ""hero"" rushes back and saves the day, and has realized that he loves her, and she's pregnant with his pups.  HEA.  But I wasn't happy about it.  I still think she has Stockholm Syndrome.Waste of time, and even $.99 was too high for this novella.",1
B004ASOR3E,A3JUXLB4K9ZXCC,"06 21, 2012",Dafna Yee,Very disappointing!,"My biggest objection to Wicked Desires was that the sex scenes throughout the book were all straight raunchy sex; there was no love involved and it is the love that makes a book qualify as a romance. Frankly, one raw sex scene after another got to be boring and i think the plot was only there in order to hold the sex scenes together.With all his talk of loving his wife, the fact remained that Michael committed adultery over a period of months (and just because he thought his wife was the whore he used for sex doesn't excuse his actions). I also took strong exception to his wife accepting even part of the blame for his actions; the blame for his adultery was 100% his! I am not a prude and I even find many of the sex acts depicted erotic if they are performed lovingly, but I agree with the reviewer that stated the language was coarse and vulgar. I don't think that the crudeness added anything positive to the story and I'm certain that Michael and Clarissa would not use that language at all and definitely not with each other.The most telling attribute of the Regency Period in England was there was a protocol for everything, even the specific way that a lady used her fan to show her interest in a gentleman. (I got that information from Google.) With protocol being so integral to society, this story was totally unbelievable. (Their oldest son would never have been put to work in the stables as a punishment no matter what he had done!)I did not find this book to be a love story and I did not enjoy reading it.

B00G1X9254,A26J2TRDPZH7RZ,"02 22, 2014",Romancing the Book,Disappointing,"Reviewed by DanielleBook provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookInto the Fire is a contemporary romance novella that fails to engage its readers and unfortunately contains numerous flaws preventing it from becoming a worthwhile read.The main issue with the novella is that almost the entire cast of characters are very two-dimensional and lack any traits that make them stand out in any way. The only character that stands out in the novella is the main male character, Luke, who tends to irritate readers with his thoughtless actions and arrogant personality.Into the Fire clearly attempts to be a romance; however the &#8216;relationship&#8217; between the main characters seems to be lacking any real feelings and the actions of the characters throughout the novella suggest that resurrecting their failed relationship would be a mistake. This leaves the readers rooting for the characters to remain apart instead of hoping that they will reunite.The plot tended to solely consist to moments of heated sexual tension between the two main characters; the actual show that the characters are reunited on to compete against each other in a cook off seemed to be treated as irrelevant to the plot despite early significance of it. Furthermore, the few issues that were required to be resolved in the novella seemed to be solved too quickly and too neatly without taking notice of other important factors.Overall, Into the Fire was a disappointing contemporary romance novella.",1
B005LVV6DI,A3HOKG0VCXSEHT,"05 1, 2012",Michelle @ In Libris Veritas,Very frustrating to read,"This was a frustrating short story to read. While the writing is not bad the flow of the story is all over the place. I actually enjoyed the way Knight's writing felt at times, but then the story would speed up suddenly and it no longer mattered. The relationships in this practically sprang out of nothing and her connection with Benji felt premature and childish due to the speed at which it developed. Also the over use of brand names was extremely annoying and was just too much. I also question the main character's thought process and if she had any sort of common sense.I do give her credit for trying to breech the subject of peer pressure but the execution could have used some work.

I did not connect with any of the characters, save the king of the Vampires and the leader of the Legacy, neither of which were main characters. The two female protagonists were unlikable, so I was not really invested in their quest.Add to the shallow characters the fact that it was interminable long, to the point that I was hoping every sentence would be the last, this book was very difficult to finish.

I'm not sure what everyone was raving about?!  This story is disturbing.  An 18 year old high school student who is mentally unstable aggressively pushes and pursues her 32 year old history teacher to the point of harassment.  She comes off very unlikable- crazy, manipulative and a whore.  The teacher pushes her away until he just &#34;gives in&#34; and they start a &#34;love affair&#34;.  I couldn't find the love or the passion in this story and quite frankly was just creeped out by the whole thing!  The story switches POVs and continuously switches from past to present (which I'm not a fan of in storytelling).  This was done to add an element of suspense to the story.  You know something bad happened but you are not sure what, when, how or to whom.  I reluctantly read the entire book just to get through it to see where the story would go.  The only likeable character in the book was the psychiatrist.Don't waste your $$ or time on this one!",1

Having read most of the books on Amazon on Evernote I had a host to compare it too. This is by far the worst I've read. Very little on how to use Evernote, uses, tips, etc. But really the book is VERY short and not well put together. Even Indie authors should take pride in their work and put out a good product. Not to mention the fact that the author may be in trouble with Evernote for using their logo on the cover. The title ""Evernote Essentials"" is a mirror of another well respected book on the subject called ""Evernote Essentials"" that most Evernote users have heard of or read. So with all of that said, its obvious the author was trying to just cash in on the Evernote popularity by stealing both his cover and title from others and slapping together what can barely be called an eBook. I hate to be harsh but the truth is the truth.Update: After I put up this review both the Title and Cover changed so that's at least something.

She shows up at his house, they have several exchanges where they trade guarded contempt, and yet within a couple of days they are smoldering with passion for each other.Oh, dear. Turns out Emma ran away from an engagement to a stuffy British lord. And Ben had his heart broken (and his right hand shot through) in the Yukon. We are subjected to pages and long paragraphs of confused inner thought bemoaning their complicated plight.Interspersed with this are wooden ""journal"" passages from Ben's time in the Yukon (the reason he needs a typewriter girl). These are about as exciting as a 5th grader's forced summer diary.If the maudlin ramblings of cardboard characters float your boat, this may be the book for you. I've read a few historical romances that I've enjoyed. I was intrigued by the mention of adventures in the Yukon during the Gold Rush, and hooked by the gorgeous cover. Oh, and it was free. But a great cover doesn't make up for meandering, sophomoric writing about irritating people. The author doesn't show the reader what these people are like, she simply tells us. In spite of relentless stage direction (she moved her hand to the right and looked up at him, he stepped forward, waited a moment, and then ducked his head while he reached for her... that sort of thing), the author fails to paint a picture. She fails the POV test, too. Rampant head-hopping is a sure sign of a writer who hasn't bothered to learn the craft.I pushed on through this cold wasteland as long as I could, but gave up at 35%. The blurb promises nothing more than the formulaic lovers-pointlessly-torn-apart-must-overcome-(contrived)obstacles. This is a mine long ago worked out. I'm moving on to a new claim.Edited to add: Months after writing this review, I noticed the ""gorgeous cover"" I mentioned has been changed to a ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" disaster that would have made me run the other direction instead of trying this book.

All the characters acted like teenagers - or rather like spoiled children - and I failed to find them engaging or funny. The humor bordered on bathroom, with a lot of sexual jokes. Lucy was just too klutzy to be believable - for her own safety and for the general public at large she should have been banned from wearing heels, because every time she put them on, she fell in a most destructive, dangerous and humiliating way. That got old real fast.The other off-putting thing was the grammar. I should have quit when I read the word queue when ""cue"" was certainly intended. I should have quit when I read the sentence ""Her and Scott went to the airport early."" I kept plugging away though, until I realized that I felt like I was watching a train wreck.Read the sample before purchasing! The opening with the pantyhose is by far the best that I read.

Apparently the murderer is smart enough to plan and carry out several murders and leave undetected. But the murderer doesn't realize that Bubba is buying time for the police to arrive and rescue him, and continues confessing and explaining everything. Really?

We're introduced to a myriad of caricature chick lit cardboard cut outs characters, a surfeit of angst and lust before we've finished reading the first chapter and a lackluster tale.I'm assuming the author intends to publish 3 books based on a set of triplets called Billy-Jo, Betty-Jo and Bobbi-Jo. This isn't a joke- that's really their names. The hillbillies are aware of their unfortunate name hence I thought, perhaps not all is lost. However, their constant irrational fighting was ridiculous and tedious. Even teens would be embarrassed by such immature conduct.It's also pretty incestuous and weird. Bobbi or Betty had a fling of some sort with the hero, Logan. But now he's pursuing the heroine. While Shane (a former beau of Bobbi or Betty) is chatting up Billi-Jo. Charming.Billy-Jo and the hero (in the first few chapters) rarely spare a word to each other but we can't have a scene without one or the other thinking how hot his/her bits are. And yes, Logan Forrest is really hot. He's the tall, dark handsome cliche that's found in every chick lit, but other than that he doesn't seem to possess much personality, intelligence or witty banter. The dialogue was dry, the story dragged and the fighting was over the top.There's also all these evil background characters who seem to be solely placed as a foil to make the hero (and the next installment of hero's) look good. The worst being Seth Longford, who is not only a pale, short and ugly comparison to our tall, dark handsome hero, but is sexist, crude and resembles a spiteful 14 year old. The hero keeps company with this dude because they're part of the same hockey team - clearly the hero is desperate for team mates because this unrealistic caricature of a ""bad guy"" spends an awful amount of time with him.Additionally, Shane will be the hero in the next installment. He's a damaged brooding badboy type (most likely tall, dark and handsome too) and an ex con. A tortured soul with a dark passion for Betty or Bobbi whatever,. He's hurt and jaded by love, life and all things nice. We're introduced to him in this novel and also to Bobbi-Jo or Betty (the chick he'll end up with). This charming sister has agreed to marry a dweebish lawyer and that's the dweeb lawyers fault for not being manly, passionate, blah blah. Of course he will receive his just desserts for not possessing these attributes (and for being a law-abiding citizen and an achiever) when Bobbi betty whatever leaves him for Shane - can't wait to read the next installment yay.... NOT. . .=======================Billy-Jo is a 25 year old former professional ice hockey player (who played i Sweden because they allow women in their non-contact version of the sport). She suffers a head injury (probably explains her lack of grey matter) and returns to her home town. Here she family drama with her sister, a melancholy (quite touching) reunion with her father and grandfather and suffers sexist remarks from former classmates when she decides to join an all male hockey team. She also encounters her childhood wet dream Logan.",1

I'm still trying to scrape blackened cheese from the pan after 24hrs and 4 trips through the dishwasher. Thank gawd I didn't use a good pan because I'm probably going to have to toss the one I ruined attempting that recipe.I cannot imagine the author tested any of these recipes.

While that wouldn&#8217;t be all bad because of her newfound friends and boyfriend, Dante, Kirsty wants the life that was stolen from her. Once she&#8217;s lived the years she&#8217;s due, she&#8217;ll gladly come back and live out her afterlife in Hell.Conrad &#8211; the guy responsible for Kirsty being in Hell &#8211; has other plans. Kirsty discovers he&#8217;s planning to do to her aunt the same thing he did to Kirsty so that he can stay alive. Kirsty will not let that happen, so she enrolls in Reaper school so she can earn her own scythe to use to drag Conrad to Hell. Will she be able to graduate in time?I honestly wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of Kirsty. She struck me as being very self-centered, not taking into consideration whether her actions would have a negative effect on others. Going hand in hand with that was the fact that she seemed really immature. I was shocked when I realized she was 26. She seems much younger.I didn&#8217;t really get to see enough of Dante to form an opinion on him. He&#8217;s on the sidelines for most of the book. He seems like a good guy, and I thought it was cool that he was the Dante (of Dante&#8217;s Inferno fame). Other than that, I couldn&#8217;t really form an impression of him.I think my biggest problem was that it felt like the book was trying too hard to be funny. This really served to disrupt the flow of the plot for me, and I found myself rolling my eyes more often than laughing. An example of this would be Kirsty referring to a character as having an emotion &#8220;written all over their face&#8221; and then say, &#8220;No, not literally.&#8221; It just really threw me out of the action.As I said before, this is the second book in a series. While I for the most part had no trouble following what was happening, I still feel it would be best to read The Reluctant Reaper first, mainly in order to meet characters who Kirsty mentions in book 2, but doesn&#8217;t give us back story on. I really wish I could have liked it more, but in the end, this just wasn&#8217;t my cup of tea.FTC Advisory: Pocket Books provided me with a copy of Scythe Does Matter.

The main character, Chloe is extremely neurotic, insecure and desperate.  Even through all of that, I found myself shaking my head at her actions because I did not find them believable.  Daniel - I couldn't even understand the supposed motivation for his behavior.  I don't know many that would b#@ch and moan because they were rescued from a war torn country and adopted by a wealthy man that obviously cared about him since that didn't seem to be among his flimsy confessions.

It's not fair to us, the readers and consumers, to have to wade through this cess pool of poorly written, poorly edited, few pages of what some are qualifying as &#34;books&#34; these days.  I believe &#34;Indie&#34; authors should have their opportunity to be published but not at the costly expense of the readers.  Amazon should be ashamed for letting this fiasco continue but I think as long as they are making money Amazon could care less.  I guess the best we can do is read the reviews before purchasing as some form of protection.  Whoever thought there would be a day when &#34;buyer beware&#34; applied to a book?",1

Ellie, who has no writing experience, has no intention of writing a memoir of her marriage to Gerald until she realizes how completely broke he left her. She decides to write a memoir of her life with the great writer and how it was far from the fairy-tale marriage she thought it would be when she married him. Her husband was a completely reprehensible man who seduced her and spun her a web of lies in order to get her to be with him. She suffered a difficult life with him, being the fetcher of coffee and the women that waited on and for him while he did what he pleased, continuing to have affairs with other women and just expecting Ellie to bite her tongue and keep a stiff upper lip, which she did.I did not enjoy this story at all, which was kindof disappointing since I usually really enjoy Jennifer Weiner's writing.

B00CIIFV8S,AR7ZG5NSYLL31,"05 27, 2013",My Full Bookshelf Reviews,Very Boring,"I strongly disliked it. So, while I am going to try to not be too mean to this book, please understand that this was a very painful book for me to get through and that the tone of my review will most likely reflect this.I read this because well, it was a clean romance book. And a boxed set too! Three stories in one...for freeeeee! You can't pass that up, can you? Well, I couldn't, but I really should have.First complaint: the characters are one-dimensional and basically are all alike with the exception of William, and that was only because he was a guy. Oh sure, the author TRIED to make them different--one of them has issues with her sister,they're good at different things , but it just didn't work. There was actually one secondary character, Grace, who I thought was pretty unique, but the main character's only major difference was their names.Secondly, the dialogue felt forced and unreal. I would give examples, but I think that in order to get the full effect, you have to read the entire book. (Trust me, not a good idea. I suggest just taking my word for it.) Anyway, the characters just don't speak...normally. There's no other way to put it.Third: it was rather boring! Sometimes, I can give a one-star worthy book up to three stars because the plot was still interesting, even though everything else stunk. But this book is about three Amish girls who find 'true wuv.' And the plot was very rushed, as well, though I didn't have a problem with that because, honestly, I couldn't wait for this book to be over.Also, William's story was bizarre, and at least three quarters of it was a dream. A dream! You think he finds the girl of his dreams, and then the author says something along the lines of &#34;then Daniel woke up.&#34; Ugh, I HATE when that happens!No, I don't recommend this book. But, if you read the full review, it's pretty obvious that I don't. I don't know...maybe someone will like this, if they positively love Amish romances. But that doesn't mean I would recommend this to them.",1

B003SX125S,A1TFMR7RE985MF,"07 12, 2010",Countess Chocula,Mind controlling magic masquerading as erotica,"Tessa blows into Darinthian Ambassador Kortal's office looking for her missing sister on his home planet where people are ""linked"" by magic - as Tessa and Kortal are now, according to some gut feeling of his.  Apparently, this means now that she's entered his domain, she's surrendered to whatever he wants, which he tells her is her ""body, mind and spirit.""Moments after he tells her this, she's inexplicably, violently crazed with lust until he satisfies her (quite easily), then as she tries to fight him, he subdues her with sex again, then he builds her up and demands she wears his collar, which she agrees to in a haze of lust.  He ties her up because he knows when the magic wears off, she'll be ticked off and try to leave him before he can do the sex mojo thing on her again.It's all explicit and if you like that kind of thing without it being necessarily erotic or having any emotional element, than you'll enjoy this.  Tessa and Kortal have absolutely no emotional connection; she's his possession from the moment she walks into his office and she's struck deaf and dumb with lust immediately because of some super mind-bending ability of his; when he's not around, she comes to her senses, then loses them again when he returns.This is from Ellora's Cave, and if you're familiar with them, this particular story would fit with their Exotica collection in my opinion (it contains stories that are more unusual, push boundaries and don't necessarily include affection or happily ever afters), although I don't think this writing is up to par with the authors that are generally included in that series.",1

It was one of the worst books I have ever read. (I would say the worst, but I've had the misfortune recently to review so many bad books that I hate to tempt fate.)As other reviewers have noted, the Goodreads synopsis sounded promising. Unfortunately, Reed Bosgoed's horrendous writing and the complete absence of any coherent plot destroyed the book's potential. I am one of those irritating people who always sees typographical and grammatical errors. Usually, I feel compelled to note them on my Kindle as I encounter them; it was a measure of how abysmally written this book was that even I finally gave up marking all of the tense changes, punctuation errors, misspellings (a simple run through grammar check would have pointed out that assent, ascent, and accent have different meanings), and ridiculously poor word choices (I can't think of the last time so many people &#34;wended&#34; their way somewhere).I agree with reviewer Lillian that The Purging can best be described as &#34;a screenplay for a really bad action/horror flick.&#34; Had I not felt the same ethical obligation to finish and review the book expressed by reviewer Telma *.*, this book might have been the first book ever to defeat me.I strongly encourage Bosgoed to find a good editor and proofreader before he even considers publishing the second volume in his Eons of Darkness series.I received a free copy of The Purging from the author in exchange for an honest review.",1

B00H7GA0FK,A24YAIIB6HBO7J,"01 8, 2014",alon,"Simply horrible, and in so many ways.","I'll preface this review by saying I've read Saxon Andrew before...the Lens of Time series wasn't a bad bit of escapism for what it was. So, in this book I expected there to be no characters, but caricatures. I knew the romantic subplots would be sophomoric and puerile. I also expected the main plot to be handled with the subtly and nuance of repeated hits to the groin with a ball bat. And I was right.What I didn't expect was the lazy, sloppy, error riddled, quasi-political rant that was Jesse's Starship.It wouldn't be fair to simply call this ""left-wing propaganda,"" though I can see where that comes from. I actually can't tell the author's personal politics from reading the story other than to say his simplistic, black-and-white stories tend to leave no area for interpretation. On one hand you have the call for personal disarmament, yet on the other the advocacy of an Orwellian society in which the ""Hunters"" get to impose summary death sentences on those who aren't ""peaceful."" Let that little bit of irony sink in... Even if Saxon was using this book as a vehicle to promote political views I disagree with I would still happily read it (if it was a good story, and this one had real potential), but I'm not sure that was his goal or if he was even aware of it. There were too many contradictory principles for me to think this was his intent. Or, more to the point, I don't think he's a good enough writer to even attempt it. His books tend to have that training-wheels-just-taken-off feel in that it's a struggle just to muddle along. I will say this; being condescended to by a book that is so poorly written was more than a little insulting.The big part that bothered me, from a technical aspect, is that if you're going to write about the military, LEARN about the military. First off... they're Navy SEALs, not Seals (It's an acronym, Saxon. They're not sea mammals.) The Navy doesn't have ""Sargents"". In fact, NOBODY has ""Sargents"". They're sergeants, and only the Army, Air Force, and Marines have them. The lack of knowledge about almost every aspect of the military (that is available on Wikipedia and a dozen other sources for free) makes this book almost impossible to enjoy. It's just like another ""military"" sci-fi book I suffered through recently... if you're too lazy to do even a modicum of research, why make it the centerpiece of your story?So why 1 star? Even though I'm still not sure Saxon was grandstanding about the second amendment or a right/left paradigm, I did get that he has a genuine contempt for the U.S. military, which was juxtaposed with a breathtaking ignorance of the very people and institutions he so freely disparaged throughout the entire book. The combination of that made the book entirely unpalatable and more or less guaranteed Saxon will never get another dime out of me.",1

So, Ethan puts together an elaborate ruse to get David on an island alone.  Then, he tells David that he doesn't get any food or shelter unless he submits to his whims, and that he can't leave.The author kind of tries to paint David as conflicted rather than completely against the idea, but really - it shouldn't matter should it?  Even if some part of someone wants someone else, they should still get to choose.  And no, having food held hostage while the other person gets you worked up and then pretends your final acquiescence is consent is not a real choice.I can't figure how anyone thinks this stuff is romantic at all.  BDSM is all about the submissive partner having the power to put a stop to the behavior or the relationship at any time.  Once you take that away, it isn't games between consenting adults, it is just bullying and abuse of power.  Bullying and abuse aren't romantic, even when the victim claims to be OK with it.  I spent the parts of this book that I managed to finish feeling awful for David, who was being bullied into doing something he did not wish to do.I do wonder why we've managed to reduce the prevalence of rape fantasies in m/f romance, but people still accept it in m/m romance.",1

B00505DKNE,A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,"09 23, 2011",morehumanthanhuman,Materialistic wish fulfillment fluff,"Vampires, in the post-""Twilight"" world, have become a real mix-and-match type of character for authors.  If you don't like certain characteristics associated with vampires, just make up new ones.  Have your vampires drink from animals, go outside (and sparkle), do whatever you feel.  What do you do, however, if even new style best-of-all-possible-characteristics vampires aren't special enough for you?  Enter the ""vampeen,"" a rather unfortunate name that sounds more like something that Edward might pull out of his pants during a moment of passion than the vampire-human hybrid this book introduces us to.Lexi is a ""regular"" teenage girl (""regular"" in that her socio-economic status is way beyond that of the average teenager) who, Twilight-style, notices a mysterious but cute classmate.  He turns out to know her family and quickly lets her know that her life is about to change forever.  She's a vampire-human hybrid and all the non-human parts of her genetic code will turn on exactly at midnight on her sixteenth birthday, which - conveniently - is just a week away.  Apparently her parents thought the less time she had to deal with this the better (they also felt like it was better for a near-total stranger to help guide her through this transition).  They're really the ciphers in the book - they don't much guide her or help her at all.  Their function is to fund all her activities and discourage her from having sex.  I would figure that any person who is literally hunting humans can make her own decision about sex, but this book has the same weird anti-sex vibe that permeates the ""Twilight"" series.As a ""vampeen,"" Lexi is immortal and will gain superhuman strength and speed.  She will also lose all the extra weight that has been plaguing her and will be a perfect size four (and be beautiful).  However, vampires hate vampeens (there's a whole clunky backstory) and she is advised to maintain a low profile so that she doesn't draw the attention of the vampire hunter.  Instead she decides to throw a huge, over-the-top sweet sixteen party to debut her new size four figure in front of all the classmates who were mean to her (literally - she had two friends before her transformation).Reading this book is like getting a lengthy tour of the author's personal wish fulfillment fantasies.  She wakes up amazingly beautiful, has two cute guys fighting over her, has an aunt to take her on a shopping spree where they spend tens of thousands of dollars, gets a Mercedes, is super-powerful, has rare ""vampeen"" abilities (weirdly, the ability is ""will power""), has a perfect body, experiences an amazing love connection with a cute vampire, and becomes immortal.  I finally hit my limit when it was revealed to her that she was the one foretold in ""vampeen"" (I'm sorry - I refuse to take the word seriously) prophecy who will bring peace between the vampire and ""vampeen"" camps.  It's just too ridiculous.  At the end of the book, Lexi - out of pretty much nowhere - springs her unique theological theory on us.  Vampires and ""vampeens"" are actually God's chosen people.  Well, Lexi, I'm glad you cleared that up.  Pages and pages of how beautiful she thinks she is now, how awesome her Juicy Couture sweats are, how great her stuff is . . . it's vacant materialistic junk.The story would be enough to justify the low star rating, but the writing is what really pushes it over the top.  I thought for the first few chapters that the author had used a word processor thesaurus program to replace ""regular"" words with fancier words, giving the book an awkward feel - but then I began running into misuses that I know even a computer wouldn't suggest.  Things like ""the iPod engulfed his bicep"" (that sounds like a horrible technical malfunction), ""no indecent exposure was placating before you"" (huh?), and ""I really wish I could have captured the pure divulgence her eyes depicted.""  Those are just three misused words out of dozens.  Even when words are technically correct, the effect is so bizarre.  One character will ask another a question and the response will be several pages of stilted and floral language, an inept baroque stew of words and then other character will then respond with something like ""O.M.G!"".  ""?!"" is regularly used as a punctuation mark.  The writing is just . . . not good.",1

Jade Lee has some talent as a writer and I have read some of her other books.  This one did not suit me at all.My feelings relative to the darkness at the beginning and throughout the book kept telling me to ""quit reading,"" ""quit reading."" Wishful thinking on my part lead me to hope that Marlock's designs would somehow turn out to be less depraved than they actually were. Ugh!  Not so!  Some parts of the book implied that he was doing his protegees a big favor by training them and selling them to ""suitable"" old men who wouldn't live very long.  Supposedly, the hope was that these old geezers' desires wouldn't be depraved to the extreme, that they wouldn't live all that long and that they would leave their fortunes to their young wives resulting in the women being able to enjoy freedom and a quality of life for the rest of their years. Somehow, I was never persuaded.In my opinion Marlock was the epitome of an extremely debauched man. The behavior of Lynette and ultimately, her thoughts and values, matched Marlock's to the point one could infer that perhaps they were deserving of each other.

Again- pretty believable and interesting. So far the story was set up nicely. Even had sex in a parking lot- well, ok.

Personally I think it was listed in the wrong genre because this was not dark erotica. You cannot just write a book and throw a couple of sex scenes in it and say it's dark erotica. There's a bit more to the genre than that! Another, recently, banned book did exactly the same thing and when I spoke to the author, she said she thought because her book had sex in it then it had to go in the erotica genre!! So my first problem with this book, is that it should be listed in the psychological thriller genre, and authors really need to learn what constitutes the different genres.And now things really go downhill.....expecting to read a dark erotic novel and finding out it wasn't going to be one, got my goat straight away. It annoyed me. I thought oh here we go again and all the terrible clich&eacute;s about bandwagons flooded my brain.The blurb of the book suggested an entirely different story to what was presented in the book.I didn't like the writing style, it was too wordy, too stilted, too pretentious.The editing...well actually I don't think there was any editing.If the author's intention was to shock then I have to say he did manage to shock me, but not in the way I'm sure he intended. I was shocked by the poor writing skills, the poorly executed story, the lack of character development and just generally the indecisiveness of the author.There are far better dark erotic books out there, I've read some corkers that will tantalise, titillate and terrorise you. Books that make you feel dirty for reading them, for intruding into the lives of the characters.This book was none of this.

Nothing! She carries on sleeping with the Hero on Fridays & getting it on with the bf on Saturdays, and this continued for a few weeks. Yuck, disgusting! At first, I emphatized with her since I've experienced being torn between the good bf & attracted to another guy, but I would never had carried with a sexual relationship with someone else without breaking off with the bf.And the bf was not a bad guy at all! Granted, he was a snob towards the end, but she knew what & where he came from, the upscale folks, from the get-go, heck they were together for 4 years! And yet she could not let him go.The hero was actually a nice guy, but what can you say about a guy who knows he's fooling around with someone's gf?

I only got to  51 percent, and stopped because I could not tolerate it any longer.  I have read many conqueror books from 1066,and this book was like a comedy compared to this.  Not that there was  anything funny about this book, it just seemed like a poor attempt at writing a book about this topic from the author's part.  Perhaps as p as the author was trying to write a book about Norman conqueror's that was not the usual norman conqueror children as characteristics, and if that was the case, she failed miserably because norman conqueror's usually consummate the marriage ASAP after they are wed to the vanquished bride so that they have greater claim to the land.  But this norman hero seems to suffer from some ridiculous mental flaw, that he does the contrary, only because he wants her to care for  him first.  That's fine if  this this was a typical medeival romance book, but this is a norman conqueror who was given this land and bride as conquest.  This story was totally unrealistic for this era and I was really disappointed with this read.  I suggest that the author researches her history as for this particular era, then attempts to write a book about  and,make her next book about this era as nd the norman conquest more realistic.

I hesitated to purchase this one though, but was swayed by the glowing reviews.  Did I read the same book?This book is absolutely predictable.  Since it's a romance, you know the 2 leads will end up together.  From the book summary, you know the heroine Meg is already in love with the hero.  Also, from the moment that a certain character is introduced, you know who is making attempts on the hero's life and why.  It is patently and immediately obvious.  You also know those attempts won't succeed.  No tension or anything to resolve whatsoever.  The ""Big Misunderstanding"" played a role in this very weak plot, but it was not even a good ""Big Misunderstanding"".This book dragged on and on and was boring.  I have never skipped and skimmed so many pages in my life.  Too much telling, not enough showing.  Since everything was so predictable, I never had to go back to fill in for anything I skipped.I also didn't find it true to Regency customs.  When Sedge was sick, Meg spent hours and hours alone with him in the bedroom, nursing him to health.  There was never a mention of a chaperone being present at all time, which would have caused her to be compromised. Also, were there no servants who could have seen to Sedge, such that Meg, her grandmother and her brother (?!) did not have to look after him 24/7?  Finally, Meg's family ran a business, which means they were in trade.  Not ""good ton"", at all.  They would not even been invited to the society balls and routs of a London season.There are better Regency romances out there and better books by Candice Hern.",1

This wasn't the case though.  The story is absolutely ridiculous.  It reads like a badly written YA book.The reader is asked to believe that all of a sudden, upon first sight of a hunky police detective, the tale's protagonist, Doris, is magically over the grief she feels over the death of her husband.We are then 'treated' to a vomit inducing account of 'Insta-love' at its finest.  No matter that two murders have occurred locally, one of which is her assistant from the flower shop she owns and operates, our heroine can be found constantly mooning around over said stud muffin cop.For some reason, Doris feels it is her duty to 'investigate' the murders.  Of course, in true idiot stereotype, she withholds a written death threat made against her because she doesn't want to appear 'hysterical' in front of the police.  Never mind that she has a 5 year old son who could also be in danger; she figures she is capable of handling the case.Detective Dreamboat succumbs to the Insta-love as readily as Doris, behaving in a way that no police officer worth half a darn would.  After only meeting briefly twice before, he leaves the scene of a third murder to rush over to Doris' shop to see if she is okay.  Upon her opening the door to him, he takes her in his manly arms and squeezes her tightly, relieved that she is safe.  Tra-la-la!!  The Love Spell is well and truly cast ~ *blissful sigh*When she asks him about the most recent murder he tells her it was reported by ""...Emmett somebody...""  Oh, you mean the same Emmett that found the body of her assistant and whom he had told her about very recently?The writing is stellar...The rest of this book is a mishmash of tiresome and sappy inner dialogue, idiotic risk taking on the part of a widowed single mother...with no apparent regard for her child, and the inevitable happy ending tied up in a neat little bow.Needless to say, this will be the only book in the series I will read.",1

B0067MYS3U,A1TEH9T3XB0I7J,"05 25, 2013",daveh,There are few books I disliked more.,"There are few books that I rate a single star. Unfortunately, this is going to be one of them. I know that most readers gave this much higher marks. I don't see it, and here's why:This story is supposed to be a romance. It is in fact a story of usery. At no place in the story is either MC's &#8220;love&#8221; for one another justified. There is no causation for Lorenzo to love Jesse. At a single point in the book he states that this is where he falls in love with Jesse. But why? Because he's smart? Because he's selfish? Because he wears red high-top tennis shoes? The author presents absolutely no credible reason why Lorenzo should love Jesse. And vise versa. At no point in the book does Jesse show love for Lorenzo, other than use him for his own selfish purposes.Perhaps the author was trying to make Lorenzo into some &#8220;Christ-like&#8221; character overflowing with unconditional love. I don't give the book that much credit. The fact that Jesse uses Lorenzo's military career and his race in a totally public manner for his own professional grandiosity, political alignments and financial gain is unforgivable, especially when there is nothing at the end of the story to indicate that Jesse has repented of that sin. The fact that Jesse ends up in a hospital and Lorenzo rushes to his bedside is not a reason for forgiveness. Lorenzo says that he has no control over his feelings for Jesse is not sign of strength. I never felt that Love was a life sentence. It may be Eternal, but that doesn't mean that we don't have control over our lives. That theme is rubbish.Perhaps unknowingly, the author makes a terrible inference that it is perfectly okay for the White Man to stomp on the graves of Native Americans and then to expect them always to be the forgivers is a terrible theme to promote.What happened to the reason why Lorenzo goes to Marathon? I thought it was to be mentored by the great Jesse Sr., The Original. But only twice in the story does The Original actually help Lorenzo. From what I could see, he could have done just as well via e-mail and a telephone call. I hated the continuous usage of &#8220;The Original.&#8221; It seemed really really impersonal. The author boxed herself into a corner by trying to use the same name for two different characters. I understand that she was trying to make a point as to their military heritage, but for me it just depersonalized the grandfather.Where was the plot? The first 65% of the book was about a couple guys drawing pictures in a studio, driving around looking at Virgin Mary shrines and buying cowboy boots. The only pathos came in the last few chapters and then served only to justify that the characters were with weak or self-centered.What was the Sadie thing all about? How did that further the plot? It was unconnected and a meaningless thread.There is little to no character development. We know very little about Lorenzo. We know that he is an ex-Marine. We know that he's Native American and &#8220;un-experienced.&#8221; Other than that he's a blank slate. Other than being total jerk and a self-centered artist, we know little about Jesse. At the end of the story Lorenzo is still nave and Jesse is still a self-centered jerk.I found the dialog confusing with lack of dialog tags and jumps in the story line. I found my self confused with who was speaking and when and where things were happening.In conclusion, I know that was supposed to be about &#8220;what I do for art.&#8221; I also know that authors need to develop unlikeable characters. I'm not dis-liking this book because I didn't like the characters. I dis-liked this book because the characters were weakly developed and the story didn't hold true.",1

This book was a compilation of quotes from different people whose quote may or may not have anything to do with food or eating. There were also some good tips about what to eat, and how to (possibly) curb your cravings. But, no research or medical evidence was provided to support this author's opinion. Does the food industry put ingredients in food so we will become addicted? If so, I'd like to see hard evidence.I also have a very hard time believing this statement, directly from the book: ""I read an email from a so called expert talking about how you have to eat much fewer calories to be lean. I hate seeing so many people brainwashed with this bad information."" Seriously? I understand that many people do eat low calorie, nutrient poor and highly processed ""diet foods."" This does not mean they can avoid calorie counting to lose weight - that's a proven fact.Oh well --  if you want to purchase this book, then do that.

The writer needs to research topics on which he writes, such as Antartica or work prisons, even if the story is primarily about an alien (which, in fact, takes up very little of the story). I won't even go into minimal character development, awkward dialogue, or poor grammar/proofing.

In England at the time it would have been impossible to speak and act as these characters, they would have been considered unbelievably rude, ignorant and probably insane. Their behavior is so far off I don't know where to begin, but having a bridal-veil where you peek out of a hole in the fabric? Give me a break! It's like the heroine's family were living on the moon, isolated from everyone at a time when the social life was extremely controlled and everyone went to church often and knew the rituals. An educated lady was supposed to be able to walk and dance gracefully, be able to read and write and manage the household accounts and interact with servants, but a higher education was considered a waste. An handsome, rich, clever, aristocratic man as the hero, would have known his worth, and would also have been socially constrained to choose a wife well. No this will not do. I appreciate the effort of the author, but this is a book best forgotten.",1

B0084FH0EW,A8REIBWZLPBO8,"11 1, 2013","Amazon Customer ""ready to read""",Not a Heartwarmer,"This story was not heartwarming and did not make me feel good reading it.  The male lead, Brett is a horrible, self-centered jerk who hates children. I will not call him a hero of the story because he wasn't. Even in the epilogue he was still a jerk.  Any man who refers to children as obnoxious brats, twerps, dingbats, etc is a man who should never be around children especially yours. Sharon has a two year old son named Max and Brett makes it very clear he wants the mother and not her son.  He wanted Max to go away, to disappear so that he could be with Sharon without her obnoxious brat around.  Taking daddy classes did not seem to make any difference.  If a man does not like your child and lets you know it, then he is not the man to fall in love with and marry.  Brett never bonded with Max he just sucked it up and grudgingly accepted Max because he wanted Sharon.  Brett even put the child in danger and admitted that he didn't care if Max ran away from him as long as Max was a way from him. After Max has an accident from Brett's negligence Brett just abandons Sharon.  Sharon let her loneliness and her lust for a man get in the way of her providing a good loving father for her little boy who was still a baby.  I really hated this story and almost put it down but I wanted to see if Brett redeemed himself in regards to Max.  He didn't, which was even more disappointing. The dialogue in Brett's head about Max is cringe worthy.  It was uncomfortable to read.  I read this book in a boxed set.  I generally like books that feature children and family settings. This book was a huge disappointment. It was the first one of the Daddy Series by Judith Arnold that I have read and I won't be reading any more.",1

However, in this novel there were too many of my worst pet peeves gone too far for me to overlook them. While the story held good promise, the writing and editing were so poorly done that it detracted from the story almost to the point of making it a humorous farce rather than a good, steamy story.I know that nobody is perfect, but this book seriously needed some basic proofreading and some editing by a real-live person who could give the author an honest opinion on the amount of &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; required to accept this too-unrealistic-to-be-accepted story. is difficult to notice the story and its merit with a rampant list of grammatical sins.To name a few: tense shifts, character confusion (often, in conversations where the actual main character is referenced by a different name she is called by a her best friend's name or worse. in one particular instance Scarlet is speaking and calls her best friend by her own name (calling her Scarlet instead of Janie), and at least four times by my count Scarlet is referred to by the name &#34;Leigh&#34;), chronological issues, redundancy, inattention to detail consistency (Scarlet has a truck and then a car without explanation as to how her vehicle changed), noins incorrectly possessive or plural possessive, and a marked and rampant disregard for common punctuation and word choices that continued to be wrong over and over so that they were obviously not a typo (you and you're, to and too and were and we're are none of them interchangeable). At one point I began wishing for a working copy so I could mark the text to be corrected.On a more personal side, I had many complaints with the story itself. For one, it was like a copying of 50 Shades of Grey (including the wealthy BDSM male lead, the virginal college graduate, and the poor writing issues). For another the main characters' names-Scarlet and Rhett-a bit too corny for me not to laugh, would have been enough without the redundant repetition of Scarlet's favorite movie being, &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34;-why not her favorite book, too? But my main complaint was the absolute and total misunderstanding of the BDSM relationship dynamic within the main characters. And the continually unrealistic emotional behavior of the main characters chafed me a bit after the third description. The exorbitant, exaggerated reactions to things and a complete 180 degree turn with little reasoning or provocation in the next paragraph made me groan in frustration and actually remark aloud to myself at the ridiculous and unbelievable quality of the characters as they were written.The story would have done better if the writer had sunk half of her descriptions and used real-human reactions rather than histrionic levels of adjectives to show what a basket case Scarlet is rather than a healthy, well-adjusted individual as she was claimed to be in the third person narrative. If I had actually know this character, I'd have had her committed after her first fetal position crying jag after being with Rhett-because she was so in love??? Nope, not buying it as anything but psychotic obsession.I cannot in good conscience recommend this book without a serious re-write or some major editing (to say the least).",1

Plot sounded very original which prompted me to download the book. The first few pages started off fine then it went downhill.  For me I get really annoyed when characters, with no backstory instantly speak of love and strong intense passion.  Within the first 3 chapters, the protagonist has visions, instantly those visions of a man turns into reality, and that reality is that this handsome and alluring man is a vampire. During this meeting she is overwhelmingly torn between love/lust and suspicion. This vampire instantly takes her to a library/bookstore and gives her books on vampire lore so I am assuming they can solidify their budding relationship. While reading the books they speak all this drivel about how he is a good man and its not his fault he's a vampire and she will love him anyway- Really?  After an hour?  I admit that I could have given this story more of a chance but I also did not like her writing style.

I have had a paper subscription for the WSJ for several years but have trouble reading the small print.  Nevertheless, I renewed it via Amazon and Kindle in the apparently mistaken belief that I would be able to read it on more than my Kindle (I have two).  First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.  This isn't quite a disaster - but it comes close.If I were you, I'd buy the print/digital combination directly and use either the Kindle or the iPad - not the special app.Ok, I'm part of the disaster - I thought I was ordering the Kindle and print versions and somehow managed to just order the print version.  After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.  I can now read it on the Kindle Fire, my iMac - and if I can find my iPad, probably there.

Three dollar words to say this book was bad, really bad and boorrring. This is, also, one of the many reasons I regret buying this books. Ms. Riley often threw in a three dollar word to say something simple. I waited for the third installment of the Brian and Caroline story. And I waited to purchase it because I could tell from the cover and the excerpt that it would be dreadful. Should have trusted my instinct. I hate the cover because the characters look too young to be in their thirties and the hat on the guy is just goofy. The excerpt tells the tale. Pretentious - Porthault sheets from Paris, a 3,000 dollar a night cottage(and yes she is crass enough to mention the cost) on Mackinac island. The story could have been a short free read to let the readers know about Caroline and Brian, Tracy and Jack. Instead it was a fiasco to introduce Ms. Riley next series about an international criminal agency. Not even remotely intersted in entering that world. I did say boring didn't I. When I say reading on the life of an amoeba could have given this book a run for its money. I'm not exaggerating the love scenes were boring. The interaction between Brickman and his crew was so over the top that he was a caricature and they were tstl. I didn't enjoy the scenes with Brian and Caroline becuase it only serve to emphasize how weak Brian's character development.So, Caroline and Brian are married and sooo in love. I know because Ms. Riley told me over and over again. Brian tearing up with joy watching his wife sleep, the one sided love scenes where Brian pleasured Caroline. That got me too I realized everything centered on Caroline -her safety, her needs, her wants- and Brian was as secondary as every other character in the book. Excepty Paragon aka Essence aka Cesare the next super beautiful, super capable heroine - oh by the way, she's only 20 and a super model/assasin. Whatever. I wish Ms. Riley had allowed Brian Keenan and Caroline Singleton-Keenan(yeah Caroline hyphenated) ride off into the sunset and allowed me the illusion that they lived happily ever after. This lets me know that one day Brian will wake up and realize he's the queen's favored subject not her husband.Mainly, I'm extremely disappointed because Ms. Riley is right. The readers of At Last did ask for this. Weelll not this drivel she churned out. But I did email her about K.K's story. Richard Pryor once said,""You order s***, you eat s***"".

B00ED4WKKC,A5VXEND377FKQ,"10 18, 2013",Martini Times Romance,"Anna ""Martini Times Romance""","[...]*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*After reading the blur, I was really excited to read the story, however when the time came, I was one chapter in and already cringing at some parts.The story has a lot of potential, but it was not catching my interest at all. And it took me days to be able to make it to the half way mark before I called it a day. The main thing that bugged me and rubbed me the wrong way was that the author's writing was kind of all over the place. One minute Aubrey Walker is coming home from college because her one and only family member left in this world fell and became comatose in the hospital. Its late when Aubrey gets back into town and since visiting hours are over, she goes to the house. Well something intense happens and she freaks out. She's scared out of her mind because someone through a brick through her back car window and then when she parks in the driveway, there's a man waiting for her at her car door. She freaks out and gets out of the car and starts running.The man catches up to Aubrey and they topple to the ground. We find out that this man is Booker Outlaw. A man who knows the secret that had Aubrey leave town in the first place. It was an intense scene and I loved the suspense. It was gearing up to be a great story...but then it went flop from there.Apparently the officer who called Aubrey and told her about her Aunt's accident believes that the fall wasn't so accidental. That maybe someone purposefully injured the woman. So when the officer gets a call from Booker and Aubrey about the brick through her window, he shows up for what seems like a minute, tells them his thoughts on the Aunt's fall, and then says for Booker to look after Aubrey. It just seemed really rushed and pointless. Also, Booker and Aubrey have this mutual attraction but it's kind of coming from nowhere. They went to school together but never really talked until apparently he helped her cover up her ""secret...""The author wrote dialogue between Booker and Aubrey that didn't really flow. It was awkward, and she used words that I didn't think were right for what she was trying to really say. It just sounded weird if I'm making any sense. The author would have these two characters talk about random stuff during times that seemed inappropriate, and she tried to convey feelings that I just didn't believe. And Booker is supposed to be this best selling horror author and a ""word-smith,"" but he didn't come off as that at all.I did not finish this book because it wasn't my cup of tea. I wasn't connecting with any character, the writing kept pulling me out of the story because of how random the scenes were, and it was coming off as cheesy unfortunately. At the rate the story was going, it was 1 Olive material. Maybe others will like it, but I didn't, and after several times to attempt to at least finish it, my heart just wasn't into it.[...]",1

B005CQBCJA,A6JFZZYFUV8B3,"09 12, 2012",KarmaBites,"DECEPTIVE PRODUCT, DECEPTIVE SALES PRACTICE","FIRST: This particular product is not a romance; there is no sex, no seduction in any form but RAPE. AND MORE RAPE. CONTINUAL RAPE.Yes, I used caps.  Why?  Because I want potential buyers to know this upfront. While I firmly believe people can read whatever they wish, that choice should be based on truth, not deception. The author should have been as honest about the repeated rapes as she was about the violence. (EDIT/ADD: And no, not because I have anything against rape in books; I just wasn't prepared to read about it in this book.)Like some of the others, I downloaded this as a freebie after reading the blurb, which is buried somewhere within the excerpt, so allow me:A TRAGIC, MODERN-DAY LOVE STORY...He's a ruthless, drug-lord who kills at the slightest provocation; she's a sassy, foul-mouth, twenty-one year old who takes crap from no one. Put them together and watch the sparks fly. And fists.Add their greedy, backstabbing, amoral families to the mix and you have mayhem.Add the FBI to the mayhem and you have tragedy.Gringa is a modern-day, tragic love story that will have you laughing, crying, gasping and above all wishing there was more.WARNING: This book contains language your mother would definitely NOT approve of, scorching sex scenes that may keep you up at night, unnecessary and un-called for violence and is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18 or anyone seeking world peace just yet. (18 years that is, not months. Well, months too.)**********So I thought, ""Hmmm, interesting twist--a bit wacked, but interesting so why not?"" Also, the ""warning"" has such a cutesy, tongue-in-cheek tone, doesn't it?Here's ""why not"".  As mentioned, there's no romance. No sparks flew between them, unless you count the times he stared at her while she quaked in fear. She's left alone to be bullied by his mother and sister; a strange man walks into her bedroom and sexually harasses and assaults her. There is also strong implication that the ""hero"" and his sister are engaged in an incestuous relationship. The ""hero"" says maybe all of 5 words until just before he rapes her anally. (And yeah, I wrote the word--why not when some of the erotica sold here contain it in their ""warning""?)The FBI?  Nope, sorry--huge no show for me, must have had car trouble. For that matter, where was the romance? Because I got the tragedy. And if I ever had the misfortune to experience such ""scorching sex scenes"", then I'll definitely be up at night.SECOND: This is not part of a series; IT'S A SERIAL. An author should know, so I won't waste my time explaining the difference.THIRD: Who's Diago?  Did we read the same book?  Let's see, file size = 210KB. Check.  Print Length = 449 pages. Really? In what universe, printer or ereader? Because after running a macro to clean up the crap formatting, voil&agrave;!... I got 70 pages, with Location ending at 1071 (original = Location 3040). I'll make it easy--that's 2/3 of NOTHING stripped out.I'm sorry but who indents to 1/4 of a Kindle screen? And at this day and age, are consistent paragraphs for straight text so difficult that several sentences would start in the middle of my screen? Even a manual typewriter had a set Tab key! Finally, how does ""Chapter Three"" end up in the middle somewhere but there's no other chapter headings?The truly sad thing about this mess?  Crap formatting, grammar and punctuation (and I mean to the point that I had to pause and mentally construct some sentences to get the gist) and misleading blurb aside, the storyline concept was good and had such potential!  In fact, the beginning was creatively attention-grabbing and the first half was not bad.Skimming the reviews already here, I agree with most of what Junecstraight wrote, so I'll just end this with ""ditto"".

Molly was an interesting character: she spoke several languages fluently, kept a cool-ish head in dangerous situations, and had overcome a lot in her life. I didn&#8217;t have a very high opinion of her decision-making skills, though: who tries to nonviolently negotiate with people who&#8217;ve twice tried to kill you?? That&#8217;s not optimism in humanity, that&#8217;s idiocy.There were so many things in this book that didn&#8217;t make sense to me, as a person with at least a passing familiarity with logic. For instance, would any reasonable politician or his staff go forward with an event when a credible death threat had been made against him? At a specific event? By a suspected murderer? No. There&#8217;s idealism, and then there&#8217;s stupidity. I don&#8217;t always have the greatest opinion of the electorate, but I have to believe a man this dumb wouldn&#8217;t have made it into office. The entire third act of this book makes no sense, in light of events that take place in the middle.Grey is kind of a terrible cop. He doesn&#8217;t seem to understand strategy well, and isn't good at prioritizing. Forget police work, how did he survive Afghanistan with such lackluster instincts? He is seriously like the worst. cop. ever. Likewise, his buddy Mike seems like a terrible brother. After connecting Molly and Grey, he seems relatively unconcerned that his only sibling is in mortal danger.I didn&#8217;t find Molly and Grey&#8217;s relationship to be believable. I&#8217;ll admit, the &#8220;we fell in love in three days&#8221; stories are always a tougher sale, but plenty of authors are able to pull it off. I wasn&#8217;t convinced here. At all. I have no trouble believing that they really like each other, but I wouldn&#8217;t place bets on their odds of still being together five years in the future. I figure that they might break up once they get to spend a solid month together.This book was a huge disappointment.",1

They meet, have a few brief encounters with a lot of kissing involved and BAM, they're married and the marriage is abusive.  I wish the author had given Lily a few more ""relationship smarts"" before the marriage.  I know Lily was lonely, but she seemed like a fairly intelligent woman in the beginning of the book.  I would hope that any self-respecting adult woman would at least ask a few questions of a potential marriage partner about his history, family, likes/dislikes, etc.  I guess if the author had written according to my formula there wouldn't have been much of a story because Lily wouldn't have married Trevor at all.

I bought all 5 Katzman books together and even though book 4 had low ratings I thought it would at least give you updates of other characters in the series. Well it didn't and previous characters that seemed nice were asses in this book. Even Saris came off as uncaring at times. I agree with other reviewers that there were a lot of inconsistences in this book that were distracting starting with the letter to Rayne's father mentioned at the beginning of the book and the letter to Chellak from Bogden (part of that letter had Hassan mentioned as son and then as brother?). Then you have Rayne neglected and abused his whole life, almost raped, & then to find out his step-mom (& abusers) actually killed his father; only to have Saris talk Rayne into signing a contract with a so-called good guy, who isn't. Then Rayne is verbally & emotionally abused by said so-called good guy and good guy's so-called good family? Also why would Anjali and Marika (who are Elquone as well as bruters) just stand aside while Hassan, Bogden, & Urik all treat Rayne like garbage. In chapter 7 Hassan tells Rayne that Anjali is busy with his and Bogden's son yet in book 5 Unconventional Mate Bogden tells Semyon that he and Anjali have a baby girl. Also speaking of baby stuff at the end of this book Hassan says he's writing their baby girls name in the family book, yet at no time in the book did Hassan or Rayne ever state that the baby had been named and what her name was. Also the book seriously needed an editor for all the grammatical errors; which is a lot if I noticed cause I suck at english comp. Well all I can say now is I'll never buy another Stormy Glenn book. Not going to take the chance of more wasted money.

As usual proofreading would have helped.  The story and plot lines are acceptably derivative.  Unfortunately the writer needs to find a good group of friends or a local writers group to help him learn how to smooth the pace out.  It reads as a series of shouted and disjointed distinct utterances instead of flowing smoothly.  Think of grade school when the teacher had everyone in class take turns reading a sentence out of a textbook.  Now compare that to a professional audio book.  The jerky, halting and stumbling narrative is just more than I can handle.  All this negative stuff being said, there are good bones here.  If the author took a ""How to write a book"" class at the local junior college and based it on this manuscript then the results would be about equal to standard journeyman mass produced series book.  It could be cleaned up to be the equivalent of a basic Star Wars, War Hammer 40k, or Battle Tech novel.  But in it's current form I just could not read the last 20-30 pages.

What drew me to this book was the premise of a serial killer targeting lawyers. What a promising premise, unfortunately Clark doesn't deliver on the promise.The beginning of the story is strong as Clark pairs up a grizzled street cop and a FBI profiler. They are exact opposites so the reader is set-up for the personality conflicts that will undoubtedly arise as the duo pursues the serial killer but these conflicts never happen because Clark regulates the street cop to the background of the story soon after the beginning. The whole story takes a nose dive at this point.As the story continues the reader has to constantly battle to suspend disbelief. For example, a brother and sister who both happen to be FBI agents stationed in the Washington D.C. area. A stretch at best but I'm willing to make it to stay in the story. However, Clark includes a famous country singer for a love interest who happens to have an uncle who is ex-CIA, who will conveniently provide all the clandestine help necessary to solve the case. This pushed suspension of disbelief to the utmost limits.The corny characters were bearable but what wasn't bearable was the ending. Clark builds the story and prepares the reader for a great climatic battle between the serial killer and the protagonist only there is no battle, just revelation of the identity of the killer.First Kill All The Lawyers had the makings of a great yarn then it just fizzled.

As a 4 book omnibus it lured me in.As a pretty basic Humanity is better, stronger, smarter than all comers romp, it is fine.Where the clawing my eyes out and run screaming part comes in is the complete failure of the books structure. Spelling wasn't an issue for once, but the complete lack of any attempt at an editing pass was. Sentences constantly being changed and left part in the original, and part in the new format. In fact some of the text made me think this was written is some other language and run through some poor online translation. Viewpoints flicker between first, third and omniscient randomly.Character development is non-existent, until some one flips a switch and our bunch of altruistic geniuses become cold ruthless killers.Book 1 at least follows a typical story layout, and by itself is the gem of the series. By NO means great, but not terrible.Book 2 and beyond, they might be good some day if the author were to finish them, currently much of the story comes off as a breathless rush that presents a mere outline. Here is an excerpt from Book 2;-----""The alien ship places itself in orbit over the site and demands that we drop shields. They send some type of shuttle down near us. Communication is established with the alien ship. We demand they back off or face destruction and name ourselves. There is a long pause and they back off. We offer to give them specifications of the device that removes sand. They fire at the surface and destroy a building with molecular disruptors - are you kidding?

I skimmed through most of the last half.The story rushes at the beginning--the couple is in a relationship with lightning speed--but then the author really doesn't have the story telling talent to craft the suspense part of the story. It really fell flat. And you can only go so far with sex and shopping for maternity clothes.I found the plot to be contrived and unrealistic (these adults never once thought that having sex could lead to a baby), and the dialogue is just abysmal. (There's an instant minus, in my opinion, when the couple refer to each other as &#34;baby.&#34;)The characters never drew me in--I didn't care about any of them.The character of Selene seemed to be all over the map. Frail and fragile to the point of just silliness, and then she is the cool, calm one to deal with the villain at the end. And the villain... what a dope. Totally unbelievable.The author did try to deal with the theme of being different and not fitting in, but again it was an amateurish effort.The cover is pretty, but frankly, I don't get the title. Who is the watcher, and who's doing the watching? Selene's ability to read people's thoughts when they touch her, doesn't seem like a &#34;watcher.&#34; The villain is a peeping tom. Is he the watcher? Or is he the one watching? Or if Selene is supposed to be the watcher, perhaps Brandon is watching, taking care of Selene?

Wish I had read the first short story, since I would have stopped there.Julia Sharp (aka Shark) is the editor of Lynx Magazine, her creation and obsession.  When the stock market plummeted in 2008, Sandstone Ventures, bought 51% of Lynx and bailed her out.  Cut to today, when suddenly she is fired from her position of editor and thrown out of her offices with some lame excuse from Blake Stone, one half of the Stone brothers of Sandstone Ventures about how Julia had violated some arbitrary code.Going wild, Julia rants and raves as she is escorted out of the building.  Mark Stone, the other half of Sandstone Ventures, comes to Julia's rescue, and before the end of the second chapter, had her bent over his desk.  Thus begins a very boring story of how Julia and Mark begin a BDSM relationship in order to &#34;save&#34; Julia's magazine from falling into her rival's hands and being incorporated into Ladies World magazine.Trust was an ongoing theme in this story- trust between Julia and Mark, Julia and her former employer Janice, and Julia and herself.  Honestly, I trusted no one in this story, despite the fact that it ended happily.I've read a lot by Ms. West, and I have to say that I have totally enjoyed all of what she's written, so I was surprised at how bad this book was.  The plot was mere background for the main characters to jump each other.  Ms. West is an erotic romance writer, and the other stories I've read of hers focused more on plot, character development, and character background than this did, which was disappointing.",1

The reviews this story received peaked my interest and I decided to give this book a try.  What a disappointment!  The characters were so poorly developed that I had to make up my own vision of what the character Bobby looked like.  Kate is a young woman who is preparing to wed a rich, successful man that she obviously is not in love with, but, whom she feels will offer her security.  When she discovers him cheating on her, in their bed, at a ski vacation retreat she leaves him and promptly drives the car into a ditch.  Along comes Bobby and Cale, two former military guys who own a ranch together.  They pull her to safety and take her to bed to warm her.  As soon as she awakens, she decides they're hot, why not and gets it on with the two of them.  Their affair takes place over a week in which Kate falls in love with the two cowboys and they with her, although this has got to be the most unromantic affair I have ever read.  The plot to this story is so weak and thin as to be the most anorexic one I have ever suffered through.  I read many, many erotic books and this one does not deliver on any level.  I didn't care about the characters, I didn't believe their emotions and I was very glad I bought this title electronically.  I would suggest Amazon readers tryColters' Woman, because in that story some of the same circumstances exist with much better writing.  Sorry, Saddled will not be in my keeper collection.",1

Now, at least let me tell you why before you rate me unhelpful.","This book manages  to combine the worst aspects of military sci-fi and a Harold Robbins novel.What are the worst aspects of military sci-fi, I hear you ask. Unrealistic interpersonal situations, unrealistic human behavior, and unrealistic military behavior, all of which can be found in this book.And the worst aspect of a Harold Robbins novel? Frequent sex scenes, poorly written and, again, replicated (repeatedly, to boot) in this novel.The officers, particularly the erstwhile hero, in this book are horrible caricatures of human beings, let alone military officers. They seem to do little more than bed anything wandering into their line of sight, routinely get their people killed, and get promoted and awarded medals for each successive disaster. Oh sure, they feel remorseful about causing all that needless death, for about half a page or until a new bed partner saunters by.For example, almost the first thing our hero does on assuming command of a Special Operations type intelligence unit is sleep with his second in command, a move almost guaranteed to adversely effect unit morale and function in the real world. Unphased by this, our intrepid porn star of the spaceways then hops into the bed of the subject of his unit's protection detail. Upon clumsily leading this young woman into an ambush, our hero narrowly averts her impending rape, but only through the incredible intervention of a third party throw-away character. Of course, the young woman-- daughter of a powerful Senator-- ends up pregnant with our hero's child-- but wait! Our hero doesn't love her. He decides that he cares for the second in command instead.Not to be outdone in gracelessness, our second in command obtains her promotion based on a successful attack she leads (from far away in the safety of the rear) on a planetary spaceport. An attack which would have resulted in the deaths of most of her men, had it not been for the heroic sacrifice of the driver of the unit's APC. The second gets a promotion and a medal and the true hero of the action gets nary a mention after his death. Following what appears to be her Pyrrhic victory at the spaceport, in a fitting demonstration of the power of true love, believing her personal porn star commander dead, she hops into bed with yet another character. Not to fear, though. When our hero returns, badly wounded, he is nursed back to health by the sexual ministrations of his second.That's essentially the plot in a nutshell, with some badly described military action involving some ludicrous warrior automatons (who may or may not be alien created) sparsely interspersed in between the soap opera personal behavior and poorly written lovemaking. Between the poor plot, shallow characters, and the sophomoric behavior-- behavior which wouldn't be tolerated in the private sector, let alone in a military organization-- this book sucks throw a long straw.Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of both military sci-fi (and have been since the first time I read Starship Troopers decades ago) and of literary erotica, so I am neither a novice nor a prude when it comes to either genre. My objections to this book come from being well read in both areas and thus being able to discern the good from pure unadulterated crap. Sadly, for both the author (because I know that every book is a very personal labor of love and craftsmanship for any writer) and my pocketbook, this work falls into the latter category.",1

Install running water and an elevator in a cave that you found? I didn't think so! This story reads like an eleven or twelve year old boy's daydreams. The author pretty much knows nothing about anything. Either that or he's high on the same LSD that the cast of characters in this book are apparently using. I say this because they laugh, grin, smile, giggle, and chuckle at EVERYTHING. Plane's crashing? Laugh about it! Guy gets bitten off at the hips by a T Rex? That's good for a couple of chuckles.

This is an insta-love-triangle tale where 98% of the story you witness the female lead flip flopping back between two friends while treating both men terribly. The dialogue (between characters, as well as internal) was awkward and unrealistic which added to feeling very disconnected from the story or characters.Quince is not a good person, lies, and leads two guys on in the most unpleasant ways. No clue why two swoon worthy guys would put up with being treated so poorly either.

B00AQ4UW6W,A1MDO8RZCZ40B0,"04 22, 2013",ilbob,a lot of vague and dubious stuff here,"Another short book on bug out bags I got for free about a month ago that I just got around to reading.The intro was the first warning sign, but I persevered and continued on. Really there is nothing complex about a BOB nor does it need to be especially expensive.""Disaster can strike at a moment's notice. This leaves little time for preparation, especially if you need to get out of your home in a hurry. If you are serious about survival and the safety of your family, you should always have a bag of emergency supplies ready to go. This bug out bag should contain everything that you need to survive when and if you have to abandon the comfort of your day-to-day life, and should help you to find safety or start over if need be. Bug out bags are complex and important parts of preparing for survival, and they require packing a variety of items and tools for your later use. Preparing one of these bags can be expensive and is usually quite labor intensive, but it is well worth the effort if you find yourself in a real survival situation.""It started out with a page or two about a 24 hour pack, but never really said why this might be preferable to a 72 hour pack that it went on to discuss. It even mentions a week pack that it refers to this way ""this is a true survivalist's bag"". I am not sure why, but the book warns ""there is a better than average chance that something will go bad, expire or even break while it sits in your closet"", WRT to the week bag. I have no idea what would be so fragile that it would break while merely sitting in your closet that anyone would want to put in a BOB of any type, or why this problem would apply especially to a week bag.It goes on to talk about packs for kids and pets, some of which actually made some sense. It says that ""the ideal number of people for bugging out is two"", like you get a choice of where or who you might be around when the need to bug out comes along.Types of bags are discussed - back packs and duffle bags are suggested. I cannot imagine any duffle bag being especially suitable for carting around out in the woods as the author apparently intends.It talks about water and suggests 4 pounds of water a day (about 2 quarts). But then it says you might be able to get by with as little as 12 quarts for a whole week. Wondering around in the woods on foot the chances of you surviving a week on 12 quarts of water would seem to approach nil. The book suggests water bladders, Nalgene, and military canteens as water carriers.Water purification is next - although like most so called ""survival"" writers they just do not get the difference between water purification and making water merely potable. Boiling and tablets are mentioned as the preferred ways. It mentions filtration as well claiming ""Survival-grade filtration is a wonderful thing but it can also be hard to find."" Possibly the author has never been to a Walmart or a sporting goods store where water filtration devices are readily available.For food it merely suggests bringing MREs, despite their high cost, bulk, and weight.Cooking is next, after your MREs run out. I guess the idea is to catch food in the wild and cook it, although nothing in the way of advice on this is given. Maybe it was covered later in the book. The book goes on to talk about food storage ideas (mostly ZipLoc and Tupperware).Clothing, footwear, rain poncho, gloves, shemagh are suggested. Some of what is talked about in these sections makes sense, other parts seem so vague as to be all but useless. The part about ponchos seemed particularly poorly done to me. Without actually saying so, it seemed to be suggesting some kind of cheap, disposable type poncho, but that hardly fits in with the ""expensive"" gear the intro mentions.It then talks about shelter - tarps, paracord, stakes (metal is best according to the book), tents, and poncho shelters. Again much of the advice is vague and not especially helpful IMO, and somewhat dubious as well, especially the part about bringing extra stakes and ropes for your tent, and that tents are mostly useful when there is more than one person.Fire is then discussed. It actually says this ""Your primary ignition source should be a fire starter. The modern equivalent of a flint and steel, this item will let you create a spark by rubbing metal on metal."" Later it suggests dried twigs as tinder. I don't know what kind of dried twigs would ever make suitable tinder.At this point I just decided I had enough vague and dubious advice, so I quit reading it about 60% of the way through its 980 locations. It thus earned a single star from me.This is another BOB book that appears to have been written by someone with a fantasy that he is going to bug out to the woods for some reason and live off the land. Just not a realistic scenario.Given the vague and dubious nature of much of what is in the book, it would not surprise me to find that the author is just latching onto some kind of prepper trend that he thinks he can make some money off of, rather than someone with actual expertise in this area, not that a whole lot of expertise is necessary to put together a bug out bag.Incidentally, I read this book (the part I read anyway) on my PC. A fair number of places formatting commands (or maybe remnants of them) were visible. It seems like a quick once through would have caught that kind of issue. For some reason, these kind of formatting errors seem somewhat common with self published books. Perhaps it has something to do with the software being used. Thankfully, writing errors such as typos, spelling, and grammar issues were not common enough (if they existed at all) to annoy me.",1

My main criticism is that everything about this story felt rushed and superficial. There was no true emotion from Skyla and, sadly there was no romance in her relationship with Logan, her love interest.  I  didn't feel the love, or anger or even the jealousy she supposedly experienced. And I certainly didn't feel her attraction to Logan or her response to his touch or his kisses. The reason was the rushed pace of the writing.For example, the first time Logan the guy Skyla's crazy about kisses her it's described as, "" His tongue darts around my mouth, glides across my teeth, happy to be there.""  Later another kiss is described as, ""He pushes his tongue into the back of my throat deeper and deeper, . . .""  Where is that glorious feeling of first love? Where is the excitement, the heat, the giddiness? It isn't there, and it should be, worse, it could be.  The bottom line is that I found all the characters superficial.There are other problems with the writing and in all fairness there are some positive things to be said about the book, but if I don't care about the characters nothing else matters.",1

The only thing that the other reviewers and I seem to agree on is that this story leaves you wanting more. More description, more detail, and more explanation for what was happening throughout the plot-line. The first lesson in creating a story that is engaging and relate-able is to show rather than tell what's going on, and I feel that this element was missing from a substantial portion of the book. With more detail, I might have been able to walk away from the story question free, but instead I was left wondering: Why was Diandra's husband involved in something shady, and why didn't Diandra even have a clue that something was going on? What makes Diandra special after she's turned, and what happened to make her baby so unique? Who really killed her husband?I could add more questions to this list were I so inclined. A good story in my opinion is intentionally ambiguous, rather than lacking simply for an inability to provide answers.This story had potential. All of the elements for a great and intriguing story were there, but it missed the mark for me. There were too many things that were left unexplained and the entire story line centered around Diandra's husband seemed entirely implausible. Perhaps there are readers who can overlook such an issue, but I am not one of them.All in all, while this story might have been worth an extra star or two had the details been fleshed out a little more, it probably would never be worthy of more than three stars from me.",1

B007KAZ9ZE,A1MKIA7T0RBQCD,"02 10, 2013",somelovelybacon,Bad writing.,"I have to be honest. I expected something good about this book based on the reviews here on Amazon. When I finished the book, I had no idea what everyone else saw, because I certainly was not seeing or feeling the erotic undertones there.The storyline was good. But the writing killed it bad. This isn't to say that the author can't write, because I think there's something there. While it was okay, it was not fluid enough. To begin with, there were typos and lapses in POV. One moment she's describing what's happening and what she's feeling. In the next she's being referred to in the third person. That was very distracting.Another thing about it is that there are TOO MANY DETAILS. Details like how they kissed and whose tongue went where and where whose hands went where and how he unhooks her bra and how she slides it down her arms. Those aren't bad things in erotica, but they must be handled with enough skill to make the images convey not only the act, but the feeling as well. This is where the author fails.It was like a bad game of Show and Tell, except that this was all Telling and no Showing. In some parts it really went, ""I did this. And then next I did this. And then I did this, this and this."" It was like reading about how to proceed during sex. All Tell, No Show. Good erotica is supposed to take the reader not only into the bedroom, but also into the hearts and souls and bodies of the characters in the bedroom. This one was so badly written it felt like I was sitting at the corner of the room watching two people figure out what to do during sex.To be honest, I don't think there was much depth to the writing. It felt forced, like all the time the author was writing she was conscious that it had to be erotic so we are bombarded with erotic images. But the depth of the feeling wasn't there. Like I said, too many details, not enough emotion which is the clincher in erotica. We need not only to be able to see the lovers touching. We need to feel it too. And unfortunately, this book fails on that score.NOT RECOMMENDED.",1

First she wants to lose ten pounds, and second she has it bad for Mr. Gorgeous, Max Kramer, who she can't stop staring at as she exercises. And because of this she ends up falling off the stair climber and bumps her head,  ending up unconscious. Grace is beyond mortified, but it got Max to notice her. But because she's so tongue tied around him and he's beyond gorgeous, he goes back to working out without a single thought to her health. Grace is so far gone over Max that she thinks about him night and day. If there was only some way where she could get his attention without making a fool of herself and finally find the courage to talk to him.One man who does appreciate Grace, abundant curves and all, is Carlos the gym janitor. He knows how much of a jerk Max is when he overhears him talking to a friend in the locker room about Grace. Max has some not so nice things to say about Grace, calling her chubby, how the earth shook when she fell and how she's a ""psycho chick"" because she constantly stares at him. This enrages Carlos, but he keeps his thoughts to himself.When Grace isn't at the gym, she owns and operates the Desert Java, along with her sister Kathryn. Grace decides she needs to stop nibbling on all the baked goods she sells and gain the courage to ask Max out. Then one day while at the gym Grace tries out the new treadmills and black outs, finding herself in a new super thin body and with the name of Callie, and better yet, with Max. Plus she's the local celebrity weather girl. Grace thinks she's hallucinating and runs again on the magically treadmill and back in her old body. Now everything is topsy-turvy for Grace because not only has she gotten a taste that being perfect is not what it's cracked up to be, but being herself and finding love with a man who appreciates her, bulges and all, is one reality she many not want to give up.Half way through I wanted to throw Craving Perfect against a wall (if only it was in print form and not digital). I thought this would be a cute read, but it ended up grating on my nerves like nails on a chalkboard. Grace is obsessed with losing 10lbs, which leads me to believe she isn't that overweight. We're never told how overweight she is and it's never about her losing the remaining 10lbs or a certain amount of weight she  may have already lost. I have the feeling she maybe a size 10 or 12 and is not this humongous, chunky woman Max cruelly finds her to be.Max is a major jerk who makes fun of Grace because of her size. Again, I really wonder how fat she is? She says she has a size 8 1/2 foot, so that must make her fat, right? (I have size 9 1/2 foot, so I must be huge). Also all the beautiful, fit people in this book come across as rude and mean, including the guy at the front desk of the gym who barely gives Grace a glance because she's so fat. Grace is obsessed with eating sweets every time she works out and after. All she thinks of is food and lusting after jerky gym man. Grace is really a pathetic and sad woman who acts over the top immature.Then the book transforms into a fairy tale where Grace jumps on a magic treadmill and ends up in an alternate universe where she's a size 2 and dating the jerk Max. She ends up freaking out for too many pages to count until she ends up back in her own skin. The romance with Carlos should have been cute, but again Grace is just too annoying. I had no sympathy for her whatsoever. She has no real personality or dimension, just like the story. It would have worked better if it was a contemporary romance or chick lit type read, but for some reason a paranormal element was thrown in, which makes no sense.Craving Perfect by Liz Fichera is one of these lacking reads and a total pass.Katiebabs",1

B00FTIZJKE,AOJQ4MJARK7V3,"12 2, 2013",Book Junkie,The title accurately describes this book.,"The book begins with Mathew Jester waking up stoned next to his girlfriend, Jennifer. He is due in court that day over some lawsuit. Later when he returns home, his girlfriend is dead and the police think that he killed her.  Soon, Jester manages to break free of police custody and is on the run. He hides on a farm, at first, and meets the farmer; who turns out to be a psycho who straps Jester to a bed and prepares to torture him. Of course, Matthew escapes and continues his mad run from the police. All the while he doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. Eventually he runs into Charlie, someone who is supposed to be a friend, and learns that the whole thing is a set up. Some wealthy and connected people framed him for murder so they could televise it on a secure server and take bets. Matthew asks for Charles&#8217; help, but Charles betrays him leaving him locked in a hotel with a bunch of hitmen.The title accurately describes the book: stupid. Matthew Jester is a complete prick and an arrogant jerk who somehow managed to become wealthy. I had no emotional connection to his character at all. He cares for no one and nothing, except Jennifer, but she dies. Also, he seems to have no intelligence. The police want him for murder. He knows it&#8217;s a frame job. But instead of trying to solve his girlfriend&#8217;s murder, or learn what happened, he just frantically runs away hoping that maybe he&#8217;ll wake up and it will all be a dream. The other thing I did not get was the group of men who set the whole thing up so they could take bets on how Jester would act. Why would they do this? How long have they been doing this? None of that was really explained in the book. The ending was pathetic as well and proves you can&#8217;t trust anyone.The writing was not well done. It bored me most of the time and many of the dialogue scenes were just overly long , and added nothing to the story. The narrative read more like a to do list than anything else.

I will honestly say that I have not competed this book, nor do I plan to.

I ABSOLUTELY HATE writers that do not end their books but oh yes, just stand by and you can buy the next one when it comes out to see how it ends!  I NEVER buy the next one.There were several things about this book that I did not like.  The heroine was 26 and acted 13.  Some of her behavior got on my last nerve. Grow up for god's sake.Her comment about not neutering her 30 lb. cat really set me off.  HOW irresponsible and immature of her.  The cat is out in the woods making out with some female cats.  I just had to find homes for 7 kittens because of a careless human that couldn't bear to neuter their animal.  AND a 30 lb. cat is very overweight and unhealthy.  Another irresponsible trait that made me not care for this heroine.One scene I found a little hard to believe was these characters go out to dinner and she has the baby back ribs plus all the sides.  For dessert she gets a big waffle cone, which she didn't eat all, but a good portion of. Then about 4 hrs. later she is eating a whole pizza.  REALLY?  And she has the flattest stomach around?  I don't think so.And what was up with all the Hello Kitty crap.  She is 26 years old and her kitchen and bedroom is filled with Hello Kitty?  She was a VERY young 26.I read a LOT of romance novels.  The first thing that grabs me is the cover.  Give me a gorgeous male on the cover and I will get the book.  Now to say that 26 was too OLD to be on the cover surprised me.  I don't think the average woman wants a 19 year old boy.  Give us a seasoned MAN on the cover.  Maybe the teens would go for this, but this book wasn't really teen material.Now, for the hero.  YUMMY doesn't quite describe this guy.  OMG he is a hunk with an out of this world WOW factor.  The author outdid herself in making you fall in love with this guy.  There should definitely be more out there like this guy.  WHEW, wow a guy.About the ending.  It pissed me off.  I could probably write it for myself because we all now how it is going to end.  But, I really hate it when the author chooses to not end the book.  I often wonder if perhaps she doesn't feel she can sell the next book without the cliffhanger.  I don't know but it turns me off to their other works because I feel this is what they are going to do again and since I don't like it, don't bother to read any more.Obviously this is just my thoughts.

It misses some of the most vital points essential to long term survival and labors on about inconsequential nonsense. For instance it recommends purifying water before drinking by adding drops of bleach while completely ignoring the fact there are many different kinds of bleach - some of them poisonous. Chlorine (sodium hyperchlorate) bleaches won't harm, but ammonia or some acidic or industrial bleaches can kill. He recommends a cellphone for communication even though cell towers are some of the first technology to fail. A compact solar chargers plus UHF CB with the emergency channel, marine, and air channels are what you need. The list of essential supplies to be carried if you have to abandon your home is ludicrous. The list of foodstuffs to store isn't much better.

Texas, in this book, is home to wanna-be rapists and people who smell like feces and horny grandmothers and adults who struggle to understand basic concepts.  And Lanie, who escaped to LA, so she's all right.It's hard to get excited about a man when an early scene features him in an outhouse and struggling to find toilet paper.  In that respect, I guess the author does the best job that she can recovering from this self-inflicted wound.

First, you must have the world collapse in a manner that, while not fully believable, is somewhat feasible. Obviously during this phase you have to deal with the rotting corpses of most of humanity, what has happened to the overall topography and whether or not there is any hope for recovery. Secondly, you have to develop a reasonable plot line whereby a band of heroes successfully fight off the forces that have caused the world collapse while attempting to salvage what is left of humanity. Lastly, you need to tie the entire tale together in a rational manner explaining what occurred and how, in spite of the odds, civilization has or has not the hope to go on.Our co-authors did none of this. Instead we have corpses, automobiles, street signs, etc... magically disappearing. Then we have a dispersed group of characters who, through magical 'dreams', eventually come together with little or no planning on how to deal with the global tragedy. The characters are very shallow and have very little, if any, believability about themselves. The 'monsters'? They are the strangest and most diffuse group of nightmares you will ever encounter! Being a dystopic novel fan I can honestly state that this is the worst story I have ever encountered!In conclusion, while I support and encourage the publishing of e-novels because of it provides an avenue for unknown authors have their works published, it also allows unskilled and sophomoric pieces like 'Yesterday's Gone' to be thrust on the public. As a reader the only manner you have in deciding on a purchase is through the summation reviews of other previous readers. Unfortunately this does not prevent the author's friends and relatives from writing promising reviews in order to lure people to buy the novel in question. That sets a trap that the serious reader too easily falls into. I got caught in this trap! Please avoid my mistake and move onto something that is more feasible and not so poorly done...........",1

As it happened, I was so distracted by choppy sentences, unbelievable reactions and unrealistic events, I did not enjoy this at all. I only finished it to see what the author did to the characters.Examples:The main character, Greg, single parent of a little girl, ""forgot how short a 6-year-old's attention span was."" No, not if you truly are the sole caregiver. You LIVE with the short attention span.After standing in line for admission to a shelter, in the cold of December, the father takes his shivering little girl to a recently re-met ex-girlfriend's apartment, at about 4:30 in the afternoon, where they drink hot chocolate to warm up. The ex-girlfriend is in her nightie already, but they all decide to go out to a park on this cold, darkening December afternoon. After playing on a swing, the little girl comes back to her dad, and he helps her on with her coat. What, he lets her play outside on a cold December afternoon without her coat on? That must have been some powerful hot chocolate.*SPOILER ALERT*:The father tries to insist on going into the operating room with his little girl who's about to have brain surgery. Please. When she comes back to her room, she's comatose, but not in ICU, not on a ventilator, and there are no nurses around.The father decides he needs to help someone, so he wanders corridors of a hospital with no interference from anyone, makes his way into an adolescent psychiatric unit (which has apparently no security nor locked entrances) spends 5 minutes with a suicidal teenager (who is alone--seriously?) and miraculously, the teenager decides not to kill himself. (Psychological therapy is obviously inadequate to the situation.) Not only does the teen decide to live, but he goes to all the other adolescent patients and convince them life is worth living.THEN the little girl's physician, who has been totally intimidated by the father, offers a job to the high school dropout father, training him to be a counseling therapist. Just like that.Maybe the author should have just told the story of Greg as it happened, how it effected him, and published it as a short story. I'm sure that would have been much more interesting.

Description of characters was only cursory - one had red hair, another was tall - not enough to distinguish one from another.  They were all puppets with no motivation for anything they did, so the author just told you. (Remember, show - don't  tell.)Since this was a first book, I'm sure the author will be getting better with experience, but I won't  be reading any more of her work.

Now I'm pissed...Is there some &#34;School for Unethical Writing & Publishing&#34; out there some people go through where they can learn such &#34;dirty tricks of writing&#34; like &#34;Double-Spacing your lines, and increasing your FONT SIZE to artificially inflate your book size!&#34;. Or maybe there's a special class on &#34;How to take a normal sized book and dissect it into three or more parts and call it an 'Epic Series'!&#34;The product info says &#34;Length 230 pages&#34;, but in reality, once you remove the double line spacing, it is an 115 page book... hardly worthy of being called a &#34;book&#34;, much less a &#34;short story&#34;; no, this is more aptly a CHAPTER really, in a potentially much greater book!To the Author: Michael, Michael, Michael... While more alluring and quicker, the &#34;Dark Side&#34; is NOT where you wanna be my friend.

She's been forced to drop her book prices because as people catch on, they're not buying anymore.Like her, Mr. Southwick has great potential talent, yet it is being tainted & threatened by GREED. He needs to turn off the word counter, and just write!

We spend too much of the story meeting the main character before the trip.  The amount of hyperbole he throws out while watching tv and at work is over the top.  He exaggerated so much early in the story that at first I didn't believe the extent of his experiences with the car rental people.  And while bad customer service can be funny (at least in hindsight), behavior this bizarre and borderline criminal is so outlandish and so unreal that it kills the parody.

If the author thinks this will entice readers to try her other offerings, she is mistaken. Aside from the formatting errors and typographical errors (extra or misplaced punctuation, missed words, misspellings, etc.), this book is littered with sentences that simply make no sense. ""Her honey touched brown hair glistened under the late winter sun and the dew from the grass also hung in the sky on her nose."" What? ""He drove over the roads he grew up on as a child, riding his bicycle and falling from it for the first time, over the roads he walked to school on, over the roads he had his first kiss."" Good grief.I could picture the author with a well-thumbed thesaurus in her lap, searching for an unusual word to take the place of the common. It gives the book a seriously disjointed feel.The degree of detail is mind-numbing. I don't think I ever found a noun that didn't have an adjective attached to it, and many had three or four.""She snipped a few deep pink roses with the pruning scissors she kept in her side skirt pocket, a pocket stitched just below a 1920's German Dresden Wire Mesh purse dangling from her left shoulder."" Or, ""A wood picnic table under a large cascading tree sat next to a blue green lake. Two lit candles sat in the middle of the worn wood table with two plates of delicacies... Two long elegant glasses stood next to each plate, filled to the brim with white champagne. Rebecca in gaiety scuttled to the decorated table and smelled the plate of food as she sat. She laid her Dresden Wire Mesh handbag on the chair beside her. The soft painted pink petals and pale green leaves decorating the bag were a perfect compliment to the nature encompassing them.""People in this book rarely just move from one place to another. They bounce, scramble, lunge, scamper, scuttle, leap, plod, amble, or stumble, sometimes for no apparent reason.""Rebecca leapt into the air, eager to enjoy the Valentine meal with the man she loved."" And yeah, sometimes they just jump around for the heck of it. They rarely just speak. They bellow, interject, argue, insist, giggle, demand. And guffaw. Now, guffaw is a word one might use once in a novel with the right tone. The author used this word no less than four times in the first 35% of this novel.It seems like every new scene gets a full description of what each character is wearing. ""Eli took off his long, brown coat and wrapped it around Rebecca before they sat. She snuggled with his coat pulled over her long, beige skirt, white blouse and sweater, burrowing her head into his shoulder and neck.""Dangling participles and odd sentence construction ruin the flow of the writing, to the point where there is no flow at all. The author head-hops, changing POV willy-nilly. Where was the ""editor""? None of this should end up in a published book.Finally, this book contains the most ludicrous ""love"" scene I've ever had the misfortune to read. I actually guffawed. At that point the novel turned into a parody for me. I could no longer take it seriously.I only made it to 37% and had to give up. I don't care one whit what happens to these ridiculous people.",1

There are a number of books I've read and quit before finishing because they were so bad; and I did not post a review.

On the positive side, he clearly is quite knowledgeable about health organizations, pandemic protocol, etc.  I would not be surprised to learn that he works in the field of epidemiology.  His language level is also quite good.  You don't find too many misspelled words either.  BUT, this author has no idea how to construct a proper sentence.  He just runs on and on and on, adding commas and other punctuation where they don't belong.  It is not uncommon to find what is written as one sentence that actually should be three, four or more sentences.If Henley is operating under the assumption that his run-on sentence style is an acceptable writing format, he is badly mistaken.  This consistent pattern of extremely annoying sentence structures is not only unacceptable in writing, it would be intolerable listening to someone talk like that.I don't care how smart an author is, or how knowledgeable they are in the field being written about, IF they fail to communicate with proper sentence structure.

I was disappointed in the ending, (I'm assuming that the third book was the last book due to the title The Triligy Saga) so many questions left unanswered.  No closure, especially with Imogen and Lucius, these two characters were the reason I kept reading.The author has  potential but he lacks following though with certain story lines and tying up all the loose ends. A lot of the story lines were way to confusing and didn't make much sense to me.  In the future the author needs to hire a better editor to go over his material before he publishes it.  Way too many errors in this triligy, very frustrating trying to read through them all.",1

Well that is not completely true, he doesn't really get in that much trouble it seems even though he should be in serious serious trouble for what he did. That is not something I take lightly at all and well...he is just lucky it was not worse. Still he didn't see many repercussions from his actions.Hmm what else....well the mom.

This book I didn't much care for, even though I did manage to finish it.  Where Nicholas was entertaining in book 1 he was just plain annoying in this one.  His constant stomping around like a toddler, flying off the hook and not letting anyone explain anything made me keep thinking he needed to be on some serious meds.  Either that or he needed someone to explain to him that not everything and everyone revolved around him.  His callousness with Shannon appalled me and his acceptance of his mother's actions was disgusting.  I think Shannon was supposed to come off as a strong character but to me she seemed spineless.  The way she let Nicholas talk so horribly to her every time he misunderstood what was going on amazed me, especially since she was always so quick to forgive him.  I'm normally the reader who roots for the main characters to work out but when reading this book I kept thinking she could do so much better than him. The ending really disappointed me.One last BIG pet peeve of mine - Nicholas and his best friend Jase are always bantering back and forth, insulting each other.  Why is it an insult to men to be called a girl?  It felt like half their insults consisted of calling each other &#34;little girls&#34; or saying things like &#34;my sister can hit harder than that&#34;.

But as an avid reader, when I see a book with several stars I assume it is probably decent. In this instance, I wonder if the 5 star individuals were friends or just going through a romance drought.  This book was not good.  At best, it was ok!  After reading part one, (which was good), this book was a letdown.  It really didn't make sense!  I think the author was trying to ensure a sequel but made too many characters seem questionable and one-dimensional.  It had the making of a good story, but didn't reach its goal.  One reason was too much info causing it to drag and be boring at some points and not enough info at other points.  Information was also out of sequence. I had to skip an entire section which occurred after the climax of the story.  They went into great detail about what led them to her.  Who cares at this point?  This could have been condensed and maybe placed sequentially prior to climax.  I am also concerned about the degrading of this Black woman.  I don't know if the author is a black woman/white man or what.  I do know that I read these books for enjoyment and escape.  I don't want my fantasy having someone pee on me!  And don't say that you are trying to make it real.  This is not real!  When you (that's if you are black) get a chance to write your fantasy, why would you include your worst nightmare?  Nope!  Your fantasy typically includes you as beautiful and desirable.  Many want you, but your hero can't live without you.  You have obstacles in your romance, but in the end, love wins out.

The h then cries about what an awful friend she was for not being there for her best friend and how sorry she was that she was dead and unable to apologize to her for all the hurtful things that she had said to her.  WHAT?!!!  So...the best friend sleeps with the H and the h is apologizing?The story continues pretty much with the same tone.  IMO, the H did nothing to win the h back or to build trust again, it just happens as though it was a given: the h will take the H back.  The reconciliation was too easy and the H was completely unimpressive.  All his actions spoke of a man with little passion or action.  For example, the h sees him in bed with her best friend but he won't go after her because he believes she should go.  He thought that the OW might have been lying about the paternity of the baby after they had sex but he marries her anyway.  The OW had a miscarriage, the reason he married her, but he stays married.  This H sucks!Worse of all, the entire story they kept talking about the OW as though she was not a huge source of betrayal among them.  Things like ""your house is beautiful, she must have really loved it"" and while skating mentioning how the OW went skating with the daughter all the time or what a wonderful mother the OW was.The comment that the h said to the H mom towards the end of the book pretty much sums up the book : ""I should have stayed and fought for him.""  Really?  Because in my book I would fight to get rid of a man who would sleep with my best friend, made no effort to make amends and then complained about how hard HIS life was because everyone knew he cheated on her.  I have read brilliantly written stories about reconciliations before; this one is simply not one of them.",1

It looks like a compilation of recipes the author found interesting that she put a preface on and called her own.  I believe this because there is absolutely no consistency in the format of the recipes, they switch between grams and ounces, spelling ""color"" versus ""colour,"" and the yields are all over the place.  The science of soaping, lye calculation, oil characteristics, molds, colorants (what the heck is micka?)...  all the many variants that make soaping so fascinating and unique are expected to be understood. This could almost be overlooked but to barely talk about safety is unforgivable. The author spares a couple sentences about protective gear and there are a few warnings within recipes, but lye is extremely hazardous and needs careful handling. In recipe 7, the recipe states, ""add water to lye"" which any soaper knows would cause a LYE VOLCANO on your countertop. Always add lye to water. Oh, and what kind of water, tap, distilled? Another recipe calls for 20 ounces of soy. Soy beans? Soy milk?  Even something as ordinary as hard water can cause wild fluctuation in results.

However, to my disappointment, there is not a hint of flirtation or courting in sight. Instead, this set includes a mixed bag I found difficult to wade through.Rather than a 4 book set, there are 2 short stories, a 50-recipe cookbook (plus 7 recipes after each short story), and a ""SAMPLE"" of another writing Yoder has done. Interspersed here and there are study questions and From the Author comments for a couple of stories. There is no consistency in book flow and design, and as an avid reader of Amish fiction, I did not obtain the book to browse through recipes--non-Amish recipes at that.Then there is a concept in the series of short stories to tie them all together by a washday competition between Amish wives, which is actually a clever spin. However, the idea loses focus and meaning when sandwiched between a litany of recipes, study questions and author comments. The washday concept also has nothing else to do with the storyline or ultimate point of each tale, which is the sign of a novice writer.Since Yoder was a new writer, I gave this second book a chance. What I find frustrating as an Amazon consumer, is that time and energy has been given to releasing a large number of additional titles rather than learning from reviewer comments, fixing what's broken, and updating the titles that have already been published. Sadly even if the writing and material improve, I am not willing to read or gamble any money on this writer's efforts to find out.It does need to be noted that this book was purchased for 99 cents , and I have since deleted the book from my library.",1

That they did in spades.If the design and inclusion of people and objects on the cover had much symbolism for or connection to the minds of the Beatles, it wasn't proved by this author in this book. Indeed, he mentions that some of the Beatles' own suggestions were overruled for various reasons, and that many others were included by the art director to fill out ""the cast"" (to, presumably, cause the album to be talked about.) There's no indication anywhere that any of the Beatles had input into where these cut-outs were placed.It's a short read, but I found in very annoying and had a hard time plowing through to the end.

I read the reviews, and they convinced me to buy this book.Then I began reading it.  The forward/introduction had me worried.  The writing in this section was inconsistent and rather unorganized.  The author jumped right in with her hypothesis that Theodore Roosevelt had ADD, or ADHD, or at the very least an artistic syndrome that caused him to act the way he did.  She then related his behavior to hers.  I was immediately put off by the writing in this section and had to convince myself to read on.The first chapter was ok.  The author quotes a lot of other biographers and documentation about TR.  The material is better organized than in the forward/introduction.  There are times where the quotes she provides are about a later part of his life, not the current part she is discussing.  Also, I always thought Teddy's illnesses and struggles in his childhood were integral to who he became as an adult, but the author does not really focus on this at all.  I am now becoming skeptical.The second chapter begins to discuss the ADHD/artistic syndrome hypothesis.  The author names a few other people (mostly around Roosevelt's time) who may have also &#34;suffered&#34; from these syndromes.  There was not a lot of factual support for this, and it seemed more like a comparison of traits rather than proof.  This discussion really turned me off to the book.  I told myself I would commit to at least 20% until I gave up.After the death of his mother and wife on the same day, the author tries to show the difficult time TR had with is life and how he engrossed himself in work.  Chapter 3 begins with a quote from TR, then the quote is repeated 2 paragraphs later.  Then there is another quote that is presented that was again not from the time period the author was describing, and I finally gave myself permission to stop reading.  I was only at 16%.I think it was the writing style, the way the material is presented, and the organization of the book that just didn't work for me.  I rarely quit reading books.

The politics only enhance the honeymoon and subsequent adventure!  This is book 4 - I recommend that you read them in order...  When you read these books please keep in mind that wolves are involved and they are violent by nature.  You cannot take this violence out of context or take out of context Michaela's reaction to it.  At no time has the author used events for the sole purpose of thrill value!  I can't wait for the next book!  Enjoy!,1

I dislike real religion, and I rarely download a book that is so overt in it's god references. That being said I am fine with religion in some situations, or if it is not a focus of the story. I even have a few books that are strong with the god stuff so I have to chalk up my dislike of this book to the way the author presents her god and the faith associated with it. What I expected was a creepy novel about spirits and talking to the dead, I was not expecting the religion that went with it. I also had some issues with the main character, as well as the views described within the text. I didn't like the choice aspects this author weaves into her story and I didn't like the main character and in general her attitude. This book was not my cup of tea, and by simply including in the description a bit about the ""faith"" aspect of this story I would have been able to at least go in with an idea that I may be slightly annoyed, as it was there was not only no warning of the annoyance to come but the presentation of that aspect was then flawed on it's own.

I live with several cats, and thousands of pounds of cat hair on everything, and the fur sticks to the rough cover incredibly well.I put Falkor (my PW's name - the luck dragon from Neverending Story) in and closed the cover.  I like the magnetic closure, and I was surprised that when I opened the cover, my PW turned on.  There is also a magnet in back, so when the cover is folded back against itself for reading, it doesn't flap around.I don't really need Falkor to stand up - I usually read in bed or on the couch, so I'm holding it.

Schreiner ""smexybooks""",The Stolen Luck,"Lord James Dupree needs to preserve the vineyards his family owns and keep his mother and daughter safe from harm. Long ago, an elf lord gave his family a talisman as a symbol of friendship. This talisman brought good fortune to James and other noble families. But as time went on, the friendship was forgotten, but not the luck. Years ago, Jaime's family's Luck was stolen when his father was murdered. Since then, their vineyard has suffered and James's wife got sick and died. James will now do anything to get the Luck back, which means kidnapping an elf. James is pretty sure the thief stole the Luck to get into elven lands, and that he died somewhere over there. He now needs an elf to help him find those lands, and he knows just the person.Loren was kidnapped awhile ago by a vicious man and is now his slave. James wins Loren in a card game, and starts the slow journey back to his lands. Loren has been badly treated and doesn't trust James one bit. James abhors slavery, but he is so desperate to get the Luck back, he decides to keep Loren as his slave just long enough to reach elven lands and then he will let him go.This book has an initial good set-up. Both James and Loren are kind people. You can feel James's torment as he is excited to finally have found an elf to get back to elven lands to find the Luck, but at the same time he feels shame that he has to do it through slavery.As I continued to read though the story really stalls. Once James has Loren, they travel back to James's vineyard where nothing really happens. There are a few action scenes because Loren's previous owner isn't happy he doesn't own Loren anymore, but otherwise, it's slow. Loren and James do get to know each other but I feel like their relationship doesn't evolve well. I kept asking myself, why are they attracted to each other? What characteristics draws an attraction from one to the other? I felt no motivation from either for a relationship.I was also disappointed with the plot. Why did we go back to James's vineyard for so long rather than go explore the elven lands? When we finally did get there, things fell apart further as James and Loren were not even close to being in love. There was even a point at the end of the book where James does something that I found not to be a trait I like in my romance hero. I won't say due to spoiler but it frustrated me.No sexual tension or great chemistry in this one. I can't recommend.",2

It's a shame that a good idea was ruined by really bad writing.  The author apparently doesn't have the faintest idea what commas are for, because they are used when they shouldn't be and are unfortunately lacking where they should be.  Lack of commas results in run-on sentences that defy translation.  Errors like &#34;could of&#34; instead of &#34;could've&#34; or &#34;could have&#34; are frequent, and the writing style is amateurish and annoying.I would like to excuse all this by the fact that the author was born in Europe and so came to English as a second language.  But the biography indicates that a lot of writing has been done since then, so one would assume that a better grasp of the English language would have taken place at some time.  My husband came to this country at the age of 40 with six languages in his grasp, and, although he is not an author, his writing (when he does it) is absolutely correct.  Hmm.

My big complaint over this book is that it is boring.I read Book 1, liked it and bought Book 2 immediately but Books 3 onwards won't get a chance.  The reason:?  I am about half way through Book 2 and have lost interest because there is nothing new happening.  The bad guys all have psychic powers that they should be able to just finish off any opposition but after torturing them almost to death, something unbelievable happens and they escape.  The author also spends far many pages on a Eulogy for one of the characters who has barely appeared in the book.  Then there are far too many pages spent on the wedding of two of the characters describing it in almost minute detail.  One page on each would have been plenty in the context of the story but I guess that would have made the book too short.However, my main dislike of the book is that the person who is to defeat the forces of evil hasn&#8217;t even been born yet.  How many books does the author intend to include in this series?  The forces of good are down to almost zero participants and zero resources right now and we are to believe that they are going to hold out for another 20years or so for the saviour to be born and grow up?  &#8216;Get real !!&#8217; as we say down in this part of the world.Sorry but there are far too many other books worth reading to spend time on a book that is not going anywhere fast.",2

If I had wanted to read a supernatural book then I would have picked up a book in that genre. Plus it was felt the main character needed yet another wife because three wasn't enough. Then the argument he attempted that these marriages were about love and not sex was overshadowed by the new lady in the house, before she became his wife, feeling &#34;alone and separate&#34; from the family until he took her to a back bedroom and banged her. But, again, it's not about sex. Right. Some of his soap box moments, which TJ does have, felt very political and antireligious in nature.

Since I buy kindle cases primarily to make sure my kindle is protected, this is a huge issue for me.First, it is a keyboard + case. The keyboard is a small Bluetooth keyboard which syncs quite well with the device and is easy to use and set up. The case itself folds out to create a kind of stand, and when not in use the case folds back up so the keyboard touches against the kindle's glass screen. I found the case itself to be poorly made. By necessity the top half of the kindle when seated in the stand will be unsecured. This poses a big problem because when not folded out as a stand, the Belkin case could slip off and the kindle will fall out. Second. The triangle stand kept collapsing when I tried to use it. 75% of the time it seemed to collapse under the weight of the kindle making it really unstable. Disappointing.The keyboard itself is tiny,and when the case is collapsed the keys are pressed up against the glass which seems an unlikely design.Overall, the case itself needs a re-design or the one I have is defective.

For example, Galvinston/Maurice has sex with just about every female character in the book. The only explanation was that he had  &#34;high sexual appetites.&#34; Ok, I could have been alright with that if he had a reason for being such a freak, but there was none.  He was a medical  doctor who will probably end up a future HIV case because not one time did I read that protection was used. It was just so unrealistic.My number two reason for not liking the book was that the sex was so bland! At those parts, I felt like I was reading a commentary of someone watching a scene, I did not feel engaged one bit. In fact, the sex scenes were so over the top badly written and silly sometimes that I had to gloss over them. SPOILER: The scene where the couple is in the woods and Belvyn ultimately gives Joe the reason to call her Cupcake was so bad that I blushed out of embarrassment because of the writing. I can't believe no one critiqued this before it went to final print.The third reason revolves around the names of the characters themselves. I was so irritated with keeping up with people's nicknames, and real names that I had to stop reading for several minutes. Had I been reading this in printed paper book form, I would have thrown it.If you are a literary masochist and enjoy reading bad erotica that sets your teeth on edge then this is the book for you. Otherwise, keep it moving.This book has as much character as a cadaver. The pace of the book was ok, and that is the ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one.For the record, I wanted to like this book which is why I finished it.

K-- is a gymnast, a young single lady who doesn't date much and is within a week of graduating from college. J-- and T-- are close friends, werewolves, who like to share women. J-- meets K-- in a bar and knows she is his mate; the strong attraction is mutual. There is the issue of &#34;what about T--&#34;; no great surprises there but a nicely developed plotline. K-- doesn't know anything about werewolves, and that is the 2nd shoe to drop.The novella is well written up until K-- finds out that J-- and T-- are werewolves (4 star, maybe even 5 star). After that, it is barely worth skimming (1-star). Wow. Rarely do you see such a plummet in quality. The writing, plot, and erotica all suffer. For exmaple, K--'s response to discovering her boyfriends are werewolves is incoherent and then inexplicably turns to acceptance. Then we shift to a really lame plot about another werewolf threatening the new threesome, where even the fights somehow comes across as boring instead of exciting. There is an equally lame scene with K--'s parents, followed by a bland and boring scene with J--'s family. Yawn.The book is heavily into erotica and m&eacute;nage. The sex scenes are fabulous up until the introduction of anal intercourse, which occurs right when the writing quality plummets.

That is, of course, on top of a steaming heap of other items that are wrong with this book.Let's begin with the fact that the front cover gives the impression that this novel (or series, rather) leans to the historical side and is possibly even a tad classical. Allow me to rectify that possible assumption on the part of the reader, for it's barely historical and not even remotely classical. The historical aspects of this book are nothing more than very loose interpretations of the times, possibly based on bits and pieces gleaned from other period pieces roughly around the same timeline. In reality, it's clear that there was little to no research put into the details here. Rookie move or laziness? One can only imagine.This, of course, is just the beginning of the lengthy list that I compiled before I quit on Chapter 19...- The grammar and spelling errors are almost as frequent as conjunctions and periods. Enough said.- The characters are somehow still ridiculously shallow despite the authors attempts to shove their personalities down your throat.- The love story is borderline unbelievable, and about as romantic as crotchless panties.- The entire beginning of this story is like watching a bad porno - repeated bouts of meaningless sex, unoriginal, careless plot and b-flick speaking lines.- Completely ignorant and inappropriate speech and actions for the time period and character roles. (Reads more like a trashy, daytime soap opera.)- Contrived coincidences for plot convenience (Absolutely HATE this).- Overblown emotional responses. (*Cue dramatic look gopher*)- Do I really need to go on? And on? Oh... and on?At 19 Chapters in, if you don't give a fig about either of the main characters, but rather feel like slapping both of them (+ the author), then the verdict is..(drum roll please).. it's a bad book. No, not horribly bad to the point of 1 star... but let's just say that if you want creativity and dimension you'll have to buy the paperback, tear the pages out and use it for papier-mch&eacute;.Upsides to the book?The butler was an interesting fellow.

The match was made by her parents (who are wealthy - new money - looking to make a match with old money/influence). After something 'big' happens; She finds herself back with a man she adores as both a friend and a lover - Mike. He is a pro hockey player and is also a 'player'.This story is about how Jacqueline works to break from her overbearing/domineering parents and works to developing her relationship (and eventually making a firm commitment) with  Mike.In the process, Jacqueline meets various heroes (in both male and female versions) as well as anti-heroes (in both genders as well).This story has been played out before - but this story had a bit of a twist. I didn't like either character. Jacqueline is old enough to be able to make up her own mind and break free from her parents' influence. She attempts to save Mike from her father's nefarious threats, but her choice should be to suck it up - and get a job away from her family. She makes several bad choices. Including drinking very heavily when things get rough. This doesn't endear the heroine to me at all. She gets a lot of financial and emotional support a long the way. People do a lot of financial and emotional heavy lifting for this girl. Being pretty seems to be her main asset.Mike is also not a super likeable character. He is sexy and works incredibly hard to get Jacqueline to make a commitment. But he also makes some pretty bad choices that makes me wonder how committed he truly is to Jacqueline.They seem to chase each other in circles, rotate, then do it again. It's not heartbreaking. It's annoying.I rooted more for the pseudo-antagonist, Daniela. And the other hockey players.

B00BJG7S40,A39IOFOZOOMWEA,"04 18, 2013",Seeker,Huh?,"This book has a very interesting premise and fleshes out enough of a galactic history to make that premise realistic. The protagonist is a whinny snot nosed *donkey*. This is one of the few protagonists in books that I love to HATE. Supposedly, the character is in his late 20s but acts more like he is in his late teens to at the very very very best 21. The repartee between characters is amusing and entertaining but is overly done.The book also has structural flaws. The primary being that it is VERY disjointed with whole chapters being  almost absolutely useless to the main plot line and a blatant attempt at character building for the protagonist. The chapters are ""dream sequences"" that actually make the protagonist less likeable, hence my dislike of said character, and break up the rhythm of the book.A secondary flaw is that there is a great deal of innuendo about the past (Before Christ) interactions of the alien empires with Earth civilizations and how the representatives of those civilizations were considered to be gods. This alone wouldn't be a bad thing but the questions are asked many different times in the book with absolutely NO resolution just innuendo. This, unfortunately, leaves a great gaping hole in the book begging to be addressed. It appears to be the preliminary work for another longer plot line but is hammered to hard to be left hanging as it was.The last structural flaw were the pre-chapter ""introductions"" which were unnecessary; occasionally totally distracting to the plot line; and conflicting with the timeline of the book. The time conflicts were heavy handed foreshadowing.The first two thirds of the book were engaging, including the first, but not subsequent, dream sequence. The last third of the book is where the author lost my attention and I started jumping paragraphs and chapters (dream sequence chapters). By the end of the book, I was left with more questions than had been answered. Unfortunately, one of the questions that was left unanswered was whether or not this was a one-off or has possible sequels. This is how things are in real life but in reading a book, I really prefer to have some kind of closure even if it is to say that more could be written but probably won't.If you're looking to waste some time for a discount price and don't mind the issues I have with the book, it would be a decent but not overly exciting read.",2

I totally started to fall for him and then I remembered that this book is called ""Second Chances"" and that the blurb mostly talks about Jude.At which point I start going oh eff no, because Zach is too possessive for this to be a sharing book.Suffice to say, figuring out halfway through the book exactly how Jude was going to be positioned to get a second chance, and then having his second chance with Rori being RUSHED through the last third of the book, I did not come away satisfied.  There's not enough time spent on Jude's reformation and there's not enough connection between him and Rori to satisfy me.  I felt the strongest connection with Zach and yet we already know before reading that that relationship isn't ultimately going anywhere, which makes it really hard to get invested in it.By the time I got to the last third of the book I was really emotionally detached from everything that was going on because I couldn't connect with Zach anymore and I didn't want to connect again with Jude, who had been such an a$$ throughout 2/3 of the book.Dane's written much better stuff.  Honestly, I can't recommend this one.  I'd try one of her other titles unless you've already bought everything else she has to offer and absolutely MUST read every single thing she's ever written.",2
B00G674U5C,A3TD0S8V76P1GS,"04 9, 2014",La Languedocienne,Couldn't finish the book,"First of all, I'd like to say that I don't enjoy writing negative reviews; it takes a lot of courage & hard work to write & publish a book. That said, I couldn't get past 24% of this book, & I pushed myself to get that far. This review only pertains to the portion I read.The first issue I had was the rampant mention of brand names (clothing, electronics, cars, etc.), especially in the first 10-15% of the book. It was beyond the most extreme examples of product placement in movies & TV. I think she was trying to convey the image-consciousness of the characters, but it was annoying.In the Dedication, Ms. Ringham thanks her mother for constantly correcting her grammar. Well, she should have paid better attention. As I plowed through the book the sheer number of errors was distracting, especially when I started highlighting them & making notes. She confused words that sounded similar (consul / console, padded / patted, pack / pact, track / tract, cue / queue, leech / leach, past / passed). Punctuation issues were also common, especially commas & hyphens that were omitted, sometimes confusing the meaning of the sentence. She clearly needs to learn the correct way to use apostrophes. When I gave up at 24% I had made 30 notes -- & I hadn't bothered to highlight or note every error I spotted. I'm not the grammar (or spelling) police, but many of these errors should have been caught before publishing.The book itself was mildly engaging, but sometimes confusing & plodding.  I know errors don't bother everyone, but when I start to focus more on finding errors than on the book, it's time to give up. If I enjoyed the story more, I might have read through to the end.",2

Author does do a good job of showing Kelsey's personal struggle to move on in the beginning, from Jake's death.Scene changes were confusing as well. In one sentence she's at Jake's parents house and next she's getting ready for bed at her apartment. Characters names were incorrectly used at some points as well.Bottomline- for all the heavy stuff that the author threw in the story, it needed to be a full length novel in order to be explored and for any connection to be made to any of the characters.

I do not like the main character. I realise this is set back in a time when being racist was 'normal', but the way this book starts made me hate the guy immediately and I never got over that. I'm white and I was offended; who knows how I'd feel if I was Chinese.3. This book was absolutely riddled with typos.

Honestly, I would rather have been given this book to critique so that I could have helped the author make some improvements. I would have been happy to help.

I had high hopes when I started reading the first three books. The outbreak premise was different enough from the other glut of zombie fiction on the market that I decided to give it a try.I had a lot of WTF moments, not good ones, more along the lines of you-must-be-joking. The introduction of the radiation fallout over the character's area was barely followed up on, left dangling for an obvious to-be-continued, series placement. I find it hard to believe both the environment and the remaining humans in the area would not be affected at all even in the short timeframe of the story taking place.A few scenes struck me as contrived, the author obviously putting them in just so his group would run into some form of opposition and the reader wouldn't think the whole journey a cake-walk; which it pretty much reads as the whole time. A lot of run-of-the-mill situations: the crazy religious leader, the crazy AWOL marine unit, etc. None of which provided much difficulty for any of the group to overcome.The other reason I had difficulty enjoying the books was the horrible, horrible editing, grammar, and spelling. As a voracious reader who consumes at least four books a week, (most of them 300+ pages,) they do matter! It is a part of what separates a great author from the merely ho-hum. If I'm constantly being distracted by errors that should have been taken care of before publishing, it brings any enjoyment I might get down.I managed to finish the book in the hopes it would get better, but was left not caring what happens to the remaining group members.Final Verdict: Meh.

I was quite disappointed.When her mother becomes ill and passes away, Jennifer is left a house far up the coast in a small little town that she had never even heard of. She decides to visit the old house. What she finds is a house overlooking the ocean, a seaside house full of promise and stories. Oh, and one other thing--a ghost.The house had been boarded up for years and previous tenants of the house had run away screaming, never to return. But when Jennifer gets to the house, she finds it warm and inviting. She decides to move to the quaint house on the cliff.What she doesn't know is that the owner of the house, Paul Squire, still resides there. She smells his presence when he has been smoking his pipe, and a book that she had put away was now lying a different way then the way she had put it back on the shelf.When her friend Sue comes for a visit from San Francisco, they go for a walk where they meet a man named Ross. While back at Jennifer's house, they visit the attic where they find some old paintings that had been painted by Paul. One of the paintings is of a woman that resembles Jennifer. Sue and Ross are amazed at how much she looks like Jennifer, but she refuses to believe it.She knows she isn't alone but when Paul decides to ""show"" himself to her, she is a little taken aback, thinking that someone had broken into her home. He argues with her that this was his home, not hers.Many a quarrel ensues between Jennifer and Paul, and many times Paul becomes so upset that he leaves the house, leaving her alone, refusing to show himself. Jennifer actually begins to miss him when he leaves her.At Thanksgiving, she invites the lawyer, Sue, Sue's boyfriend Brent, and Ross to her house for a meal. She adamently made Paul promise that he wouldn't do anything that might frighten everyone. While Sue is still in bed, Brent tries to kiss Jennifer. Of course, Paul sees this and leaves her alone again.Can a human love a ghost? Can a ghost love a human? You'll have to read this one to find out.I was a little disappointed in this book actually. The writing was mediocre at best, and I found myself tending to skip ahead a few paragraphs to find out what was going to happen next instead of reading through every word like a good book would make you. I found myself wishing that something would happen between Paul and Jennifer, but I was just left wanting. I think what was lacking in this book was a good dose (or doses) of sexual tension. There was none.Also, since the writing was mediocre, I found myself dwelling on the editing errors in it, disrupting the flow of the novel with each spelling error or missing word.

Yes, I guess I was hoping for better.The story continues with danger on the track and making Sienna take the fall for it.  Harrison and Enzo still don't trust each other and two racers get badly wounded.  No one f(in the story) can figure out who would gain from this Grand Prix Sabotage, but luckily, Sienna figures it out in the last few minutes when there is no way to warn anyone.

The characters are fun people and like many said, Siena and Harrison were a stalwart couple, but maybe that is exactly why it was less than exciting overall. Well, that and that it was predictable.  Maybe if Bex had been the culprit instead.

It was billed as a Regency and I mistook it for a traditional Regency Romance. So, discerning readers beware. For those not opposed to some smut, this book isn't all that bad, but it's not really all that great either. The writing is modern, the author throws a lot of jargon around to try and give flair to the period, but at best it is a wall-paper historical with some rather amateurish sex scenes. The story-telling is ok, the plot is kind of interesting, but it hovers between where it wants to go and where the author draws her line. Which made for some awkward moments. The book could have been gloriously dark and really sexy, but the author didn't go there and we are left with a kind of juvenile story that never really grows into anything. It could also have been a sweet regency if the author would have cleaned it up. Either one would have been better than the mish mosh that we get instead.",2

The inane lesbian lover continually making salacious suggestions while the heroine is desperately working out ways to survive with her craft and crew and keep her mission afloat?  Really?  In real life such distractions to a mission would be eliminated - sometimes permanently.Leaving aside the overt sexual connotations, the concept of the story may well be good...

Unfortunately, I was really bored with the story.Delia and Simon are treasure hunting wannabes who have more luck swapping sarcastic remarks than they do in finding treasure. While investigating a mining cave for antiques, they instead find a recently mutiliated body. The adventure moves quickly from there as they encounter strange men on motorcycles, and some kind of monster in the forest.While I liked the witty dialogue, that was about all I liked. With the exception of Temi, who remained quite close-lipped and mysterious, the rest of the characters were pretty childish. There was little depth to any of them, and I didn&#8217;t particularly like any of them. The story is filled with sci-fi and fantasy pop culture references which didn&#8217;t contribute much to the story.Overall, the action was both quick and drawn out in this story. A lot of the significance of the events was left unexplained, hopefully to be covered later in the series. While the main plotline was neatly concluded, there was a lot of the overall series left open. A bit too much was left unexplained to really hook a reader to the series.

The characters and story line are the author's, so perhaps he has written what was intended.  The problem, as I see it, is that hischaracters are not very likeable.  Al three, Jorge, Rachel, and Campbell appear in both books. The reader must remember the story's context: Civilization has just ended, there isa fight for survival, and survivors are threatened by militaristic hooligans and brain-challeneged ""zapheads"".  But Jorge frequestly worries about killing the zapheads, moralityof taking things that formerly belonged to the dead, and fails to properly arm himself (he could have taken his dead employer's firearms, but didn't), and once dropped a rifle and ran inthe middle of a firefight.  The guilt-ridden Rachel frequently daydreams, lurching from one crisis to the next, forgetting that civilization has come to an end, but somehow muddles through.Campbell is so dumb that he should have been killed six times over.

A lot of the time it reads like a letter. They should know when 'who' or 'which' should be used instead of 'that' (of which there are in-numerous examples. In fact, I don't think 'who' or 'which' were ever used when describing someone or something.) A half decent editor should also know the importance of not using the same descriptors over and over again. And just not to use the same word twice too close together in one paragraph if there's any way around it. For example; 'Immediately, the intoxicating scent of vanilla and cherries permeated his nose as her signature scent assailed his nose.' There are plenty examples like that so far, and just having someone else read it over should have helped to weed them all out. It's heavily over-written and the writer couldn't resist explaining things in too much detail, then explaining them again later in the story just in case we forgot. And again, and again, and again. If the age of a character is important enough to be written in, then they should stay that age throughout the story unless years pass. One key character started out at 33, then later was described again (in case we missed it the first time) as 30. The name of one character was confused with another at one point, making me read the sentence a few times wondering whether a small child was actuallly  driving a truck, or if we'd suddenly entered his imagination. The dialogue is so incredibly wooden that after a while I was laughing out loud. People just don't speak without contractions unless English isn't their first language. And by the way, the band is known by most of the world as The Beatles', not the Beetles. Who read this before it went to print?! After seeing all of the very positive reviews posted here, I finally understand that plenty of people are either oblivious to the quality of the writing, or just don't care as long as the story holds their imagination. This author seems to have some good story ideas, and the dedication to complete a whole book, but I'd love to suggest she take a creative writing class (you'll be glad you did, just to learn the simple things I've pointed out above) and find someone who does more than a spell-check on the work.

No real interaction with the main characters or rather any interaction with any character. The most best part of the book is in the beginning when she makes her wrong number call. Everything after that is down hill sliding. The main character talks to herself and becomes a stalker of sorts. But she really like this guy after ONE short phone call. I have read better than this with the same storyline like Gina Wilkins' Hotline.,2
B007IO7C6Q,A1YEERTQ3AFU27,"05 16, 2012",Amazon Customer,Annoying characters,"This story was an irritating read. The main characters, Trey and Sierra, seemed so immature and selfish. Trey focused on himself above all else costing himself his marriage and everything he supposedly held dear. Sierra didn't share her feelings and expected Trey to be able to read her mind to know how she was faring. They lost a child the year prior to their divorce and went their separate ways in dealing with the aftermath. Trey chose a more destructive path, but Sierra brooded over the loss and didn't try to talk to Trey. Of course this was a recipe for drifting apart.Sierra looks for Trey in a bar they sing at occasionally and finds him taking body shots off another woman. She gets furious with him, but he's able to woo her into having sex with him in a dressing room to try making up. She immediately tells him it was a mistake and that she's leaving him regardless of the ""amazing"" sex they seem to have. Supposedly, they still love each other but can no longer remain together because of the hurt. He handles his hurt by immediately having sex with someone else when Sierra walks out.After the divorce Trey goes into a depression and drinks heavily and sleeps around with many women. His sister contacts Sierra five years after the divorce to ask if she will come back and try talking him out of relying on alcohol so much. She of course agrees to this, and the old feelings that never went away between the two ignite once again. From this point we have a few gratuitous sex scenes between Trey and Sierra. It doesn't seem to bother Sierra too much that she is now engaged to another man. She seems to fall quite easily under Trey's manipulations.The characters then have moments of loving each other, distrusting each other, leaving each other again, coming back together, leaving again, afraid to trust, big surprise pregnancy, telling friends/family off, etc. Sorry for the long run-on sentence, but it was easier to just link it all in there as this is basically the premise of the remainder of the story. I think the big eyeroll moment for me in this story was when Trey told Sierra he never cheated on her during their marriage. Riiiight. Truthfully, I would avoid this book if you happen to dislike stories involving selfish characters who never really come to redemption.",2

I think this is one of those books that you either love or hate with no in betweens. Actually, &#34;hate&#34; is not really very nice (how about like or dislike). I finished it (finally---put it down twice though) and thought in the after math it was just a waste of time. I did not detect any reality to Derek's plight and by that I'm not questioning his inability to perceive recognizable faces. I understand that that condition actually exists and how terrible that must be. But, regardless, Derek seemingly allows events to occur that, it seems to me, any right thinking individual would not only balk at, but do something about in a more effective way than does Derek.

B009K5F4DY,A3IT9Z7O9IK7BM,"03 12, 2013",Shirley Quinones,Not for me.,"Back when I read The Fetish Box, Part One: Open All Night I decided to give the series a chance since it is usually hard to establish a proper series especially a serialized novella. However, I like my stories to make sense and the characters and their actions to be somewhat realistic. Sadly, this is not the case with this novella.This installment starts off right where the previous novella left off with Mary ready to have sex with John. After having been left hanging in the previous novella I was anticipating this scene and all it would entail only to be left disappointed by it. For a woman who proclaimed to be a virgin Mary sure didn't hesitate much when it came to shedding her clothes and straddle John. And the don't even get me started on the lack of chemistry between those two. It was non-existent. The whole scene felt rushed and anti-climatic with no passion whatsoever and no connection palpable between Mary and John.I would like to say that it improved from that point on but what followed was a whole set of events that truly irritated and confused me. The attack that occurred in the story, which was a great concept to add, lacked in its execution adding nothing much to the story other than the fact that it brought Mary to the store where she got it on again with John.I did enjoy the interactions between the secondary characters and the introduction of Max's brother to the cast of characters. And for what is worth I do like John, a lot. I just don't think Mary is being fair to him by having sex with him but still lusting after Max.Having said all this, I recognize that maybe this is story is not for me. I don't think I have to like a heroine for a story to be enjoyable, but I have to at least respect her and understand where she is coming from in order for me to be interested in her story. It was because of this that I could not connect to her or understand her behavior all throughout the story. This only frustrated me to the point that I didn't want to continue reading. However, that was not something I had to worry about for once again I was left hanging in the end.The Fetish Box, Part Two: What Escapes is the second novella in The Fetish Box series and it can't be read as a stand alone. I noticed that there is a third installment due March 25th and I am sorry to say that I will not be picking that one up.I received this title from Pocket Star through NetGalley in exchange of my honest opinion.",2
B005G84BL0,A25P93OL9EJWUT,"02 4, 2013",Jeanne,"If not for one issue, this would be good story","This story can be read as a stand alone story if you wanted too. I did.  It gives you enough back story to still be able to follow the storyline.  I only decided to read this because I read 'Bourbon Affair' where Denn and Jake are introduced and there relationship begins.Force of Magick, introduces another witch named Raven.  You find out there is a 'prophecy' about how Denn and his brothers have a 'destined one' who equals out there magic so they won't turn bad.&lt;SPOILER> Now, here is my issue.  I have come to like Denn and Jake as a couple, and I personally don't agree to threesomes/couple.  I personally, would have appproached this storyline differently.  After some investigation Raven is Denn's destined one.  I am kinda ticked off that the brother's destined one has to be a woman.  That is just bull.  Second, Denn feels like he deserves both of them and shouldn't have to choose between both of them.  He feels like Raven is meant to be his mate and Jake is the love of his life.  Jake on the other hand has to decide to be Denn(and Raven) or just leave them.  Jake also feels a sexual attraction to Raven.  So either he can stay with both of them or leave his lover, Denn.I personally feel that Jake could turn out to be his 'destined' one. Also, if I was Jake, I would just up and leave Denn(and Raven) behind.  I would be heartbroken. I wouldn't put up with sharing my lover(or this case picking up another lover).&lt;SPOILER>If I didn't have this one issue, I would actually like this story alot.  I would probably even give this 4 stars.  It has a good plot.  The author did a good job at incorporating the necessary details from the previous stories to understand this book.  Also, it lead up the main issue for the next book.I personally, will not be reading the previous books nor continue reading this series.  I am very disappointed by how this story turned out.",2

I'm not saying I judge their relationship, I just don't understand it and I don't want to read about it. If you like reading about all that and if you don't mind open-relationships, that's cool, but I prefer monogamous relationships over anything else and that's that. :-/It was great getting another installment of the guys, though. In the past, Angelo was my favorite character but, unfortunately, he's not anymore. He's actually my least favorite now and Matt is firmly at the top. Anyways, I liked the fact that we got to see Matt get a little more intimate with Jared in public (there's only a brief scene but still, it was sweet) and I liked the fact that Zach and Angelo get closer through their little 'kink'. It was nice how everything worked out in the end even if it wasn't the way I'd like it to have ended.I will say that I thought Angelo was a freaking hypocrite the way Zach let him fool around with other guys but he wouldn't let Zach do the same. And I also thought it was way out of character for Angelo to do that since in A to Z he was pretty gaga over Zach and didn't give any indication that he'd do something like that but that's just my opinion. At the beginning, I thought Angelo was walking all over Zach but it's clear by the end that Zach actually gets turned on by Angelo dancing with other guys and knowing that by the end of the day, Angelo will always be his. Still don't understand it but all power to them, right?I liked seeing pieces of Angelo's old personality and how he could pretty much lose anyone with how he just goes off topic and then back on it again. There was also brief spurts of humor I rather enjoyed and I especially enjoyed getting back into Matt's head again.All in all, I think this would have been a great book if the whole conflict of Zach and Angelo's sexual life would have been left out but that's just my opinion and because of that, I can't recommend this book.

The world is extremely interesting. If I could rate on just that, I'd give this book five stars but I can't because I struggled with other factors within the story.What I liked is how desperate Sean was to stop reliving Cormac's ex-lovers death. I also liked how shattered Cormac still is about his past. It made for some interesting conflicts between them. I also liked the chemistry they could have had together. Bits and pieces are shown but the full potential there wasn't achieved, IMO. More than anything, I wished their relationship had been more developed because, while they might have had some attraction, I didn't feel like there was any connection between them at all. In fact, I felt like there was always Cormac's ex-lover that Cormac would put before anything else, including Sean, and I didn't think that was fair to Sean, especially after everything he just did for Cormac.As I said, the world is very interesting. It's intriguing and captivating but I didn't enjoy how it was handled. I was confused most of the time about what was going on. I couldn't understand how Sean and Cormac would get into these situations, and while they were intense and interesting, it didn't really make sense. This made reading the story difficult and I think what made the book also drag for me. I just really struggled with it. More than anything, though, the ending is what frustrates me. Sean and Cormac changed the past but nothing in the present changes?! That made no sense to me at all. Also, while I found the ending very sweet, it came out of left field for me. Sean and Cormac love each other but I'm wondering how that development happened because I didn't see it in the writing. I also really wished we got to see their time in D.C. because I felt like the ending was very abrupt in not showing that.All in all, amazing world building but everything else I was just confused on. The events they go through and how they end up where they do, didn't add up for me. I was confused on so many things that by the end, I was a bit disappointed by not only the journey they go on but the supposed love they've seemed to have developed off screen.

B00K2NT2MW,A1CDENNZT61W4G,"05 30, 2014","Heather K ""Goodreads reviewer and blogger... ...",It was a let down for me.,"This would have been a perfect M/F historical romance. This book missed its calling, I swear. I mean, the reformed rake and the young, virginal lover? It just makes sense! What doesn't make sense is this book being a GFY about two adult males.I like Lily Velden. I thought that Gay as Mardi Gras was ADORABLE and I couldn't wait to get my hands on another one of her books. However, I struggled so much with this story.My main issue is the character of Noah. He was supposed to be sort of a ladies man, someone who never noticed a guy before in any way sexual. However, he came across exactly like a teenage girl. He pined, mooned, had insta-love with his object of lust, blushed, and basically acted just like a damsel in need of her handsome prince. Now, I have nothing against damsels and princes, but when the MC is supposed to have been a previously &#34;heterosexual&#34; male, the rapid shift from &#34;straight&#34; to a drooling over every guy's ass and going gaga for a man whom he had never met was completely not realistic.The GFY... *moans*. How poorly done was that? I know Noah says multiple times that it was like a &#34;switch went off&#34; in his head to turn him from gay to straight, but surely most people would agree that it was frighteningly sudden. The BEST part about a GFY is the time. The time it takes to realize your cravings, the cycle of arousal and denial, the slow discovery. I would have much preferred this book NOT be a GFY. I think Noah being closeted would have fit the story 1,000 times better.And Robert. What can I say about him. He was the classic handsome, rakish duke, wining and dining his love interest, showing her (I mean him! Sorry, I keep forgetting!) the magic of sex, and showing him the wonders of the world. Robert whisked Noah off to various European locales and Noah acted like a inexperienced bumpkin, not like a man who had his PhD in Art History and could hold his own. He was so deferential, so referent about Robert that it irked me.My last issue is some of the phrases used in this story. Some may enjoy this style of writing but it doesn't really work for me.&#34;With each flex of my inner muscles, I opened for him, like a flower to the sun.&#34;&#34;'But what about your sweet little hole? Does your bud want to blossom again?'He returned his hand to my ass, stroking and kneading me, pressing his finger between my cheeks to gently massage the hole he'd so recently deflowered.&#34;There are dozens of quotes like those that I bookmarked.Despite my issues, there is something cute about this book. The sex scenes were often very hot (and there are a lot of them!) and I wasn't bored while reading. I think if you like traditional M/F romance and don't mind that structure in your M/M that this might work quite well for you. However, it was a bit of a let down for me. *sad face***Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**",2

I was looking forward to three good romantic comedy style books, and based on the reviews I saw, this was a steal!  Nope.  I guess you get what you pay for, but in that case, it should be free.  I admit that I only read the first book... I saw people say it's the best one, so that means that I will have to be VERY hard-pressed for a book before I venture on to the second or third.Let me start with why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  I did finish it...only because I was curious how it would end.  Also, I have a hard time not finishing a book that I start.  The fact that it was ""finish-able"" makes it worthy of a second star, I guess.  However, I highly recommend just not starting it in the first place!Why?  First of all, the grammatical errors are distracting and downright appauling!  I honestly do not understand how I, not a trained writer by any means, can usually manage to use commas, the correct version of then/than, and the correct version of possessive/plural, but a professional author cannot (not to mention the editor...if there was one).  Seriously, there were grammatical errors on practically every other page.  It was extremely annoying to me.Second, I did not care for either of the main characters all that much.  They had few likeable qualities individually, and there was almost no chemistry at all between them.  The romance seemed very forced...like I was supposed to believe they were hot for each other just because I was told as much.  That reminds me to say that this not a ""sexy"" book at all...if you are looking for that, go elsewhere.  This is pretty much a bad chick flick movie.  The writing is extremely amateur...just the wording, sentence structure, style, etc all screamed to me amateur.  It was like reading something by a teenager or early 20s person who is trying to write like an adult.  The comedy is pretty forced as well...it's not very witty.I can overlook occasional grammatical errors.  I can even overlook lack of depth, thought, or complexity...I mean, hello, it's a romance book (well, it's supposed to be, I guess).  But this was just disappointing.  Don't waste your time.",2

Arendt,A disappointing use of an interesting form,"(From my blog, Word Vagabond: Supporting Indies and Small Press)Cops, Crooks & Other Stories in 100 Words is a book of flash fiction by journalist Mark S. Bacon.  As he explains in his introduction, his goal is to write stories with exactly one hundred words that have a beginning, middle and end.While this is an interesting goal, it fails to produce an equally interesting book.  The format is partly to blame- it is very difficult to write a story with a complete arc in one hundred words without the end sounding like a punchline.  In fact, even some of the better stories in the collection come off a bit like e-mail forwards, albeit the funny ones that you might actually pass on to your friends.However, some of the problem also lies in the writing itself.  Most of the `plots' are uninspired, which contributes to the jokey feel. The best two stories, ""Thoughtful Neighbor"" and ""Never an Empty Seat at Maggie's"", are the ones with the most unexpected (and macabre) themes.  Some, like ""Dumb Criminals"", suffer from poor proofreading or writing.  The author also uses a very simple vocabulary, which reduces the chance of expressing complicated moods or ideas within such tight limits.In short, Bacon's approach to flash fiction just doesn't work well.  Insisting that every story have a resolution takes away from the mystery, impressionism, and speculation that are the strength of this form.",2

She does explain what led up to this point, however, the men never show their &#34;alpha-ness&#34; in any true sense and she just capitulates to them way to easily. None of them seem to have any friends or family as well. If she was so unhappy and lonely, why didn't she talk to them? Why is it only the three of them? The only other character mentioned is the men's personal assistant who seems to be on her side. But she doesn't confide in her either. Also, it is mentioned in the very beginning that one of the characters may not be happy with the arrangement and that line is quickly dropped, never to be mentioned again.

B00A4SCLKK,AIW9D26MST3KJ,"10 21, 2013",Ken Zufall,Why does Amazon insist on titles for reviews anyhow?,"This collection is probably a good starting point for exposure to the author's writing.  And since most--if not all--is available free on the Internet, you can check it out at no cost.That said, the author is a mechanically proficient writer--minimal grammar/punctuation errors, though he does seem prone to tense shifts, especially in his fiction.  He also has a tendency toward repetitiveness and a fairly consistent inability to be concise, in both essays and fiction.There are three stories in this collection.  ""Professor Raoul X"" is hands down the best of them.  It does suffer from the author's customary unnecessary repetitiveness and is longer than it needs to be...condensing the story a bit and leaving the structure as is would result in a better overall story, though you could also change the structure and expand it.  It also feels most like a true work of fiction, not simply a platform to espouse various political beliefs, and has the first true bit of characterization that I've seen in one of the author's pieces.  Piece rates 3 stars on its own.""What I Saw At The Coup"" is the second best piece of fiction in the collection, but that's not necessarily saying much.  Suffers from the standard verbosity and repetition as well as the author's need to have things happen now, now, now!  Lots of tell, very little show as we get the details on a Liberal conspiracy to overthrow the Constitution.  First person point of view with the narrator having all the characterization of a cardboard box, there's one awkward spot where the tense shifts from past to present while the author stands on a table to look out the window, apparently while still writing her confession.The third piece, ""Alas, Brave New Babylon,"" is a longish piece that is very weak on story.  Basic premise is economic meltdown immediately followed by what appears to be a nationwide breakdown of energy infrastructure that leads (quickly, of course) to the complete degeneration of humanity.  (Much better take on this theme--minus the economic problems--can be found in Matthew Mather's ""Cyberstorm."")  Long piece of proselytizing toward the end, where the narrator muses on the ultimate cause of the fall of humanity at length (while sitting high up on a partially collapsed radio tower that he had previously been concerned about climbing because anybody could see him from miles around).  We get a bit of economic theory but it appears that the real cause of the collapse was general moral turpitude and the lack of real men, most having been emasculated by women and society.  For a change, the story takes place over a three year period, though the reader never gets any real sense of the passage of time; in part it's because so much is glossed over, like the second year which the narrator refuses to think or talk about.  While it's indicated that it's because what he did to survive was too terrible to think about, we have no real clue what those things might have been...though given the repeated mentions of cannibalism and the narrator's obvious disgust for homosexuality, I have my speculations.As for the essays I did read, I was pretty indifferent to them.  Edited and condensed for clarity, they probably would have been okay.  Best of the several that I read was ""Benghazi's Smoking Gun? Only President Can Give `Cross-Border Authority',"" though it could have been improved by belaboring the point a bit less.",2

It was one of my favourite reads of the New Year and I gave it 5 stars, noting I was keen to see her future releases.Well, now I've read her follow-up novel, I'm a bit mystified. These books seem to have been written by two different people. The first book is sweet, sexy and fantastically witty. It has a few irritations in the plot, but it was a really entertaining, well-written read.By contrast, ""Slow Burn"" has so many things wrong with it: the sheer number of typos makes it a disjointed read (where was the editor?); the plot has so little credibility it reads like a primary school girl's fantasy; the hero(es) are hot, but the heroine is beyond irritating; the plot device of absent parents is overused beyond belief; the intimate scenes aren't particularly intimate...I could go on and on. I'm so disappointed. I'm really not sure what went on here. It almost seems like, in a desperate bid to get something else out into the market, the author has gone back and tried to rework a story she wrote many years ago, when she was probably still maturing as a writer.I haven't completely given up on this author, but I really hope she takes time to regroup and try to deliver a novel in the same league as her debut, because ""Slow Burn"" is nowhere near it :(",2

This e-book was re-edited and posted on March 18, 2013This Kindle e-book was a 271 Kb download (approx. 126  printed pages) and sold for $0.99 at the time of writing this review.SpoilersCaptain DuCreux of the space warship 'Detroit' comes across a huge object. He finds it is an alien spaceship, sends a boarding party only to awaken the dormant life on board... a cautious friendship ensue. However old enemies are hunting this alien ship... and our story unfolds.End SpoilersSome thoughts on ""Alien Civil War'...1.) I'd read some other reviews of this work that noted the number of spelling errors, etc. Maybe some of these problems were addressed and corrected with the latest re-edit, because I did not notice many.2.) I checked the product page on amazon.com and it's listed as Sci-Fi adventure. This then was either a serious attempt to write the tale of a prolonged space encounter with an alien species OR it was a tongue in cheek, space opera spoof or parody. If the former, then it contains some of the worst writing I've ever come across... if the latter, then it still contains some awful writing BUT it may have achieved its goal, because the story, told in the manner that it was, could not have been really taken seriously.3.a) we have super computer Hal (sound kind of familiar?), the A.I. of the  space fleet's flagship, who, on several occasions, tends to laugh 'evilly'.3.b) nearly every sentient thing, be they people, aliens or computers tend to speak with 'graveled' voices. ('graveled', or a derivative, appeared 38 times... verified by the Kindle search function). Very noticeable.4.a.) excessive detail with regards to numbers. A couple examples of many... five thousand, two hundred and sixteen missiles or one thousand, seven hundred and eighty two missing starships... countless exact numbers of drones, missiles, ships, people/aliens etc. were mentioned.5.) there was almost no down time... from about 25% into this book, this tale was one long continuous space battle between the human/rebel alien fleet and the enemy alien ships. The problem was that I often had difficulty telling who was who, who was winning AND if someone won a battle then the losing side seemed to return 3 or 4 paragraphs later with new and better spaceships. It just went on and on and on.5.) and finally, inane dialogues between people/aliens/computers; beings that were part of the hierarchy and chain of command. BUT having said that, there were a couple of conversations that made me laugh out loud... not sure if they were intended to be funny, or meant to be serious, but came across as incredibly stupid.Conclusion:So how to rate this...a.) as a serious attempt to write a space novel that was terribly, terribly bad... orb.) as a farce, space opera... that when looked at in that light, had some good moments.Well, seeing no sign on the amazon product page that this was a humorous spoof, I'll opt for a poorly written Sci-Fi space novel.As it is... 2 Stars.Ray Nicholsonraynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com",2

B00DUB24M8,A2VMRZD1NLS6ZY,"10 26, 2013",Angry Lions Fan,A Mess,"It would be faster to tell you what I like about this book.  Maybe my problems are because I enjoyed the first book so much and had set expectations for book 2.  This book starts a couple months after the end of book 1.  Beri and Blythe are handicapped.  Beri has wounds that won't heal and Blythe's magic is all screwed up.This is the first problem I had with this book.  In book 1, Beri kicked butt.  If you read urban fantasy you have read this book before.  This is the book where the author handicaps the heroine to show her determination, intellect, and toughness.  There is very little actual action in this book and Beri pretty much gets beat up in everything.  I kept waiting for things to get better and the book ended with me waiting.The story is a small picture story.  Its very predictable with no surprises. Even the twist at the ending is really obvious.  Another thing that bothered me is that nothing gets resolved in this book.  You get no answers, Beri is worse off at the end than at the beginning.  One bright spot is the interaction with Beri and Aphrodite.There are so many question from book 1 and they barely get addressed.  No answers abut Beri, why Aphrodite is following her, why she's so different from her twin, what happened to her so called spirit guide.  None of it mattered enough to be addressed.  The only thing that mattered was getting Nikolos back.At this point I would rate the book a 3.  The author does set up the future for possibly better books.  The author hints of a rich, more traditional supernatural world.  I really wanted to see Beri as a hunter of supernatural monsters and I still hope to see it.  Integrating mythology the way the author does is a nice touch.  Why I rated the book a 2 has a lot to do with the ending.  This is a minor spoiler.  The three months or so that Nikolos was gone turned out to be 14 months.  Beri was in the lower plane for a day or two and that turned out to be three months.WTF?!Time moving differently in other places is a standard in fantasy books.  Except making it exactly the opposite of what has been established for a predictable plot twist is frigin terrible.  I can already see the next book being overfilled with stuff and the things you would expect to get done, will linger on.  I will wait and read the reviews for the next book before I purchase it.  If the next book is written like this one I will be done with the series.  At just over halfway through this book I skipped pages just to get this book over with.I just want people to be clear that most of the book is set up, you'll know what will happen, and there is little action.",2

That is why I got this book, but it's short and very limited, it does not go in too much detail, which could be ok for a total beginner. But what I did not like about this book at all was the fact the she suggests using mineral oil as a base oil in one of her recipes. Aren't we trying to avoid mineral oil even in commercial skin care? It's made from the same type of oil as gasoline, it clogs your pores and it's just plain bad. Baby oil is not good for babies for the same reason and I learned it from a dermatologist, when my son had a rush caused by Pampers. Anyhow, this review is getting way too long.

You know when you get that feeling? You can&#8217;t wait to keep reading.Then, oh my gosh, how do I explain this story? I fell in love with the hero and thought the heroine was a PITA at about half way. Enough so I stopped reading for a while. How much spitting and fighting am I meant to take from a heroine of a story?Now it was a gradual thing, it snuck up on me, but think about it&#8230; The heroine refuses marriage to the hero at every turn, longs to make love with him (again), but is the rudest and silliest woman. TSTL, I hate so say it, but she is. She gets herself into situations over a note where she contemplated a bullet rather than being scalped by Indians. If she had waited to ask the hero what the note meant &#8230;This book, this book, it just makes me want to weep &#8230; it had so much potential. All the author needed to do was to make the heroine fight a little less, still have her be true to character, but at every turn she&#8217;s having an argument with the hero. And the hero is being humorous and good natured to her, offering her a partnership so she can learn the family business.Honestly, it&#8217;s become an effort to be in the presence of someone like her, reading her actions like she&#8217;s constantly running away, insulting him for no reason, acting like she&#8217;s a few fries short of a Happy Meal.The reason I&#8217;m so frustrated by this novel is that the writer is amazing!!! She brings me in so deep and I love that. Except this time, I&#8217;m brought deep to a woman like Lauren who doesn&#8217;t know about her past, insults the people doing her good and argues, fights, attacks, threatens, blames, denounces and wants to sell her body at every opportunity to the hero.She&#8217;s angry the hero told her friend about her sleeping with him and another man is saying she must take the hero up on his offer of marriage. Well, she blames the hero for that! Nice, huh? Last time I checked it took two to tango.But immediately she tells him she doesn&#8217;t want to see the hero ever again, she will never ever marry him, and that they have no partnership so he can hand over her inheritance. All because she says she&#8217;s been chastised, coerced and harassed all morning&#8212;by well-meaning friends who are only looking out for her. The harassment lasted for a few lines and the heroine stormed off in a huff after insulting her friends. The hero never told them exactly what happened; just that she&#8217;d been with him. He&#8217;s in love with her, trying at every opportunity to get close to her, show her what a true partnership between them would be like. He was awesome, simply awesome. He saved her life, but she doesn&#8217;t trust him.The hero is so crazy in love with her that is the only thing that keeps the story going. Around halfway, I still thought the heroine wanted him for his body and had no particular special feelings for him.He thinks he&#8217;s the luckiest man on earth, poor sod.Every idea the man has, this woman has to contradict him, or she wants something else, not because it&#8217;s a better idea, but because she&#8217;s still stuck in the idea that she&#8217;s not Andrea, so she can&#8217;t have any of her inheritance money that would be Andrea&#8217;s. But no one can tell her that she really is Andrea! She&#8217;ll probably end up in a mental institution; she&#8217;s that close to blowing a fuse. If the hero told her, she would scream, cause a fuss, try to beat him up probably and then run away again and end up at the bottom of the sea.When the hero has to leave for a few days, she&#8217;s curt and angry with him when he doesn&#8217;t reveal why. Man, it&#8217;s probably to save his sanity!When he&#8217;s gone, she insults him to one of his best friends behind his back. Such a woman! @@ oh, that&#8217;s me rolling my eyes. Every word the friend says, she takes offense to, even when it has absolutely nothing to do with her, she thinks it&#8217;s an attack on her and acts like a bitch.When she learns that the hero had ladies lining up to marry him in England, she asks casually, without any hint of feeling for him whatever, why did he not marry them. I don&#8217;t know, but I remember reading this book as a child by Roald Dahl, titled The Twits.The hero offers her a night at the theatre or she can go to the casino by herself if she wishes, but she really wants to go to the theatre. Instead of saying thank you, she accepts the hero&#8217;s offer like this: &#8220;Not very graciously, Lauren nodded her acquiescence.&#8221;She longs to be &#8216;not so easily managed&#8217;, well I must have blinked and missed that part. Easily managed? Shouldn&#8217;t she promise to follow her heart and do what she really wants to, rather than just promise to fight with everyone all the time?Oh my lord, and then the TSTL heroine makes a deal with another man, not the hero, and if he wins he gets a night with her. She must love sex or something to want to bargain her body at every turn.The hero is trying to prepare her so she&#8217;ll be on equal footing with him once he hands over her inheritance, but she screams at him that he wants her inheritance &#8230;. It just starting getting soooooo old this whole, you only want me for my money.She even says to him that she knows he needs heirs and asks if he would change his mind about marriage if she refused to give him children. It became a train wreck reading, you know, can&#8217;t look away, moment of impact is imminent.Still, I couldn&#8217;t convince myself to start the third act. DNF.",2

There really wasn't a mystery element to speak of. At least, there wasn't a resolution to my questions. I felt more like I was reading a summary of what could be a novel...a great novel possibly.

I wanted to know more, and I wanted to understand her more, but it wasn't there.The mixture of sections written at the present time and flash-back scenes was also, for me, overused in such small space. It was a little awkward to go back and forth with this technique and it ruined the flow of my reading.Despite these issues, there is another story (of the same length) written about the antagonist in The Barista, that might be on my wishlist soon.

I have been looking for some ""scary"" stories to read to get into the Halloween spirit (I love scary stories, but it is hard to find good ones). I thought yes! This is going to be so good. I loved the first chapters of Daniel's story, turning into a wolf and having no control over that was great. I loved reading it as he was just locked in his head and couldn't really do anything about it, much different from most werewolf stories. I liked Sarah's first chapters and felt so bad for her. She is locked away on an island with the Doctor and he just uses her to play his games every day. I can't imagine trying to escape every day and every day getting caught and locked back up. What will you must have to live to keep doing that. It was a great second storyline.Then I got to Jack and...well I didn't like his storyline. Something about his story felt cheesy and just not as good as the other ones. I thought maybe it would get better as I went along. It didn't. If anything it got worse.*Note some spoilers will follow as I can't not talk about the things I really disliked about this story*I was okay with everything until Jack and Daniel meet up for the first time and Jack told him the wolf was just in his head. The Doctor planted the thought in his head so well that his body actually turned into a wolf because of his mind. I hated that. It was so lame! I don't know why. I was talking to my husband about this and ranting about how lame it was and saying if this had been set in a different world than okay, but in our world now someone makes you think you are a wolf so you are a wolf? No. I can accept the telepaths, people moving things with their minds and reading minds, I can accept people who were bit by a werewolf get the werewolf whatever in them and then they turn into werewolves, or maybe it is a virus or something. All of that I can go along with so it seems silly that I dry the line at changing your physical appearance with your mind, but for some reason it was a major turn off for me. So the rest of the book was just...not good. If you like that whole mind over matter, the mind can trap you somewhere and whatnot then this story will probably work for you. For me it was just like really? That is the best you could do?Then the end. Well Jack and Daniel and Sarah are all trapped on the island. Even though it is all from the Doctors mind. So why can't they get out of there like Daniel could get rid of the wolf in his head? If it is all mind controlling it why can't they do something about it? The Doctor is too strong...then the twist at the end...not good. By that point I just thought why am I even bothering to read this? Everything tied up so nice and quickly and was just too easy to get everyone straightened out.I had high hopes for this book based on the first few chapters. They were quickly dashed and just kept going downhill for me.

And then, why oh why would anyone meeet with the killer alone?Third, the inconsistencies were too numerous to mention...much: Kevin had a key to Connor's house and then he didn't, Kevin was feuding with his father, but his sister never intervened (weird!), The federal agents never believed Kevin was psyshic and then they did with no more proof than they had previously, The Schillings wouldn't speak to Connor at the police station, but then they join his family for a New Year's celebration when he withheld information that possibly could have helped with the investigation into their son's death? I could go on...and on...Fourth, Kevin and Connor acted incredibly silly and immature to be a current detective and a retired one. Of course, how many 25 year old detectives are there out there? The banter was so bad in this novel, I had to keep going back to re-read parts to figure out what they were talking about. I also couldn't figure out the ""Trekkie"" name-calling. Was there ever a mention of these characters watching Star Trek or anything else in that vain? No, there was not.Fifth, the ending was just bad...bad...bad...These guys love each other madly, but decide to separate to different parts of the country to see if they really love each other madly. I call BS on that one.I'll certainly be more discerning with my next ZA Maxwell book.",2
B00AU2GCUK,A1IVBDLAO9MP4A,"01 18, 2013",Grampy,I Don't Get It,"""Go Figure"" by Dennis Young is not really a story; it's more of a tool intended to help children learn shapes, exercise their imagination, and interact with their parents. I tried to like it, always keeping in mind the fact that I am not one of the target audience, but I just could not make myself like it. The drawings are definitely not done by anyone with artistic talent, but I suppose it's not necessary to have artistic talent to illustrate a children's shape-learning book. Each shape has (or is) a face; children and the parents are supposed to imagine a ""back story"" for each of the shapes, discussing what they eat, where they live, what they do for a living, etc. In that regard, it seems to me some of the figures are left open to a potentially bigotted interpretation, and thus are NOT what parents should be teaching their children.Some of the shapes are obviously supposed to be people; others are difficult to classify as anything. Facial expressions are sometimes difficult to read, as well. There are exactly 3 words of text in the entire ""book""; ""hope"" is written on the roof of a building on the next to last page, and ""the end"" is written on the last page. What you get is 20 pages of abstract representations of general geometric shapes. I DEFINITELY would be upset if I paid $2.99 for this. I got it free, and I'm still disappointed.I suppose some children might like this book. I would sincerely hope some parents would be willing and even happy to spend time with their children, going through this book. But it was just not possible for me to give it more than two stars. I wouldn't give it one star, because one star on Amazon means ""I Hate It"" and those are pretty strong words, even for this book. Two stars just means ""I Don't Like It"", and that is my position. I'm sorry, but the whole thing just left me asking, WHY?I came away from ""reading"" this book with only one thing absolutely clear to me: the author, as a student, was one of those kids who was always doodling in his textbooks. I'm afraid I can't bring myself to recommend this one, but check it out for yourself and see what you think. It could be just what you are looking for.",2

The book felt underwritten in the important bits,  I couldn't feel any emotional commitment or journey.

It had likable characters that I could easily form pictures of in my head from the descriptions given. I liked the heritage included and I loved how Alana had a passion for dancing. Most of all, I liked the potential to be a really great read.However, I didn't like it as much as most people seem to. I just felt like it wasn't executed as well as it could have been. I was often distracted by the way it was written. Choppy is the best way I can describe it. There were a lot of times where there just seemed to be too many short sentences stacked upon one another. For me, it didn't flow very well.Also, a lot of times, I felt disconnected from the story. That was probably because I felt like like most of the emotions the characters had were said (similar to saying ""I am happy"") more so than demonstrated. There was so many good things going on, yet I just couldn't connect to the book in the way that is needed to thoroughly enjoy it.Overall, I did enjoy the sweet and happy story, but it could have been written much better, and with a lot more depth in order to really tug at my heartstrings.~I received this book in return for an honest review.",2

It seems the writer's abilities were not up to the plot.  In the hands of other writers of this genre, it would have been spell-binding.  My main beef was the inappropriateness of the character's responses to each other and to the situations they faced.  What was it with the laughter at inappropriate moments?  That was baffling to me.The heroine is betrayed by both her ex and her current boyfriend and yet all of that just seems to quickly melt away to the point that at the end of the book the ex and the current boyfriend seem to be on the brink of establishing a friendship.

LJ DeLeon creates a complex, dangerous world.  There are so many different things going on in the story, with intriguing supernatural elements I enjoyed, such as the various creatures and species.  From different breeds of demons, to vampires, Fae, gargoyles, harpies, even hellhounds; it's all there.However, I had concerns with Warrior's Rise, which is why I can only rate this 2 of 5 stars.  My main issue was the flow.  I felt that the beginning was very choppy.  The character point-of-view would change, and I would be confused.  Really, the flow of the story felt a little off or confusing throughout the book.  At other places, I wasn't sure how much time was passing.  The timing issues happened a few times throughout the book.  Sometimes there was too much description and repetition, at other times, not enough.  Also, I felt that the last 10-15% of the book lagged and was overly drawn out.I enjoyed the world the author created.  I liked Deva, who went through a realistic emotional journey from barmaid to leader of the Armies of the Light.  I also like how Deva was in charge, and Padraig understood this and didn't fight her for leadership.  Theirs was a good partnership, and I was pleased with how their relationship developed.In closing, I appreciated the world and the scenario the author created, however the writing did not quite do it justice.",2

B0099CUB9U,A3AM7V4Y1BI1DK,"07 16, 2013",Janell Sutherland,"A continuing family saga, not enough romance for me","This is the second novel in a series about the three Hanover brothers. Their father, Charlie, was a con man who died and left behind a trail of angry, cheated people. The grown brothers inherit a house from their grandmother, but the house is located in a small town where Charlie did a lot of damage. The first book, which I haven't read, sets all this up and shows the brothers moving into the house and deciding to fix it up and stay.A Simple Twist of Fate opens with Sophie, the housekeeper/carrier of secrets, walking in on a naked Beck, the lawyer/hater of secrets, after his shower. And that's when I noticed that my brain wasn't meshing with this author's style. The conversation was interspersed with so many little body movements that I lost track of who was speaking, and it didn't flow for me. Then another brother walked up and joined the conversation, and they were talking about how many penises Sophie had seen in her life, and it was strange. After that, I figured out that Sophie has been pretending to clean the house for a month while she searches for something important. Her aunt requested the search so she can't tell anyone. It's a secret! During that month, she has been lusting after Beck because he wears t-shirts that barely cover his stomach. Beck has been lusting after Sophie, too, because she wears tight jeans and looks cute when she carries a mop.The first quarter of the book consists of people telling Beck that he should hook up with Sophie because of his lust, but Beck says he won't because of their employer/employee relationship. People also tell Sophie to hook up with Beck, but she won't because she's on a mission and doesn't want to get sucked in, or something. That was a problem for me, because Sophie and Beck didn't interact with each other at all. I was told repeatedly that they were hot for each other, but I didn't get a sense that they had ever hung out, joked around, or said more than two words to each other, so it was purely physical. Maybe all that chit chat happened in the first book. Basically, I got no relationship building between them.This book spent a lot of time with other characters. Too much time, in my opinion, because it was taking away from the primary relationship. The whole history of the first book was spelled out, plus Sophie got to go to lunch with some girls, plus the oldest brother drank water and glared a lot. There was also an FBI agent popping up now and then who kept getting yelled at. And there was a mystery woman who would show up and say, ""I have to talk to you!"" and they would shut her down and go away. Sidenote -- Don't you hate it when characters keep saying ""I have to tell you something"" but they never just blurt it out? They allow themselves to be sent away without ever saying the very important thing that they need to say.Eventually, awkwardly, Sophie and Beck decide to set aside their hesitation and have sex. Remember Sophie and Beck? Then suddenly she's his girlfriend, and things are hunky dory, and she even tells Beck her secret! But the other brothers have issues, and then their mom shows up, and things are tragic and they separate based upon the worst misunderstanding ever until Beck's brother talks some sense into him (another ding for having third parties solve the problem) and so Beck says nice things to Sophie and then it ends. Several plot points are left hanging because there's another book to be written about another brother.For fun, let me share a few things I highlighted: ""Somewhere along the line he'd turned into a pre-teen girl."" ""He treated her to a dramatic women-are-so-difficult exhale."" ""He didn't plunk down a stack of cash on this place to listen to them bicker like little girls."" ""Running to Mom to talk about his love life? They were acting like little girls."" That's just me being picky, but enough of the manly men stereotyping negative actions as girl-like.I see this book as part of a saga about brothers finding their identity and dealing with the past. The romance is part of it, but not a big enough part. Basically, I was annoyed and frustrated with this book.Rating: CThis review also posted on Red Hot Books",2

If there are three thing I've learned in my time among the fey, they are this: don't eat anything you're offered in Faeryland, don't go swimming in quiet little ponds and never, ever, make a bargain with anyone.""Winter's Passage picks up right where The Iron King left off, with Meghan leaving with Ash to head to the Unseelie Court. Meghan successfully pleads with Ash to first visit Puck, who is still recovering and comatose in a tree in New Orleans, and he agrees. There they meet Grimalken, and are warned of a dangerous pursuer, which continues to hunt them on their journey.This was a nice little short, but I also found it somewhat annoying. It's written as a bridge story between the first and second books for The Iron Fey series, but instead of being written for fans of the series, it is clearly aimed at those who want to do a test-run before reading the full-length novels. This meant there was a lot of recapping. I hate recapping. If I needed that many details about a book I've read, I obviously wasn't paying attention, so why would I then be reading this book? Seriously, this is one of the reasons I quit reading the Wheel of Time series.Anyway, this is a quick short, and like most shorts, completely optional and I'm sure it will have little to no bearing on the overall plot of The Iron Fey. I enjoyed it, but also felt like maybe Julie Kagawa tried to shove too epic of a plot into too short of a page length. Also, I have to say, I'm a little confused by the Meghan/Ash relationship. And by confused I mean I don't like it. I get the attraction on Ash's part, Meghan is pretty, clever, brave, and likely the first completely unique chick he's met in centuries. He's warring with his feelings, and that's fair given she's all taboo and what not. I don't get Meghan's feelings. Sure, she acknowledges that Ash is hot, but considering he tried to murder her the first time they met, threatened to murder her the second, tried to murder her best friend and force her into captivity the third, and is clearly ashamed of the way he feels about her, I just don't get it! It's not exactly insta-love, but it does happen way too fast for there to be any depth, and I'm more or less ambivalent about the whole thing (that and I like/pity Puck).I realize this totally became my platform for discussing romance in The Iron Fey, but what're you gonna do? I'm just gonna say, Winter's Passage was a nice quick read, but I could really take it or leave it as far as the series goes. Cheers!",2

I thought it would be a nice break from my current tour of alpha billionaire led romance.  I love a thriller and paired with a Valentine theme, I was hoping for some hot action (in and out of the bedroom), however the action was lukewarm at best.  I didn't feel any chemistry between Tess and Jack. I felt like I never got to know Tess. Tess is supposedly an uptight lawyer who left her privileged ,moneyed world behind, but we don't know why.  Jack is still intrigued, again why because she's about as warm as an icebox. They supposedly were once good friends but this is but a blip in the story.The 'mystery"" behind Jack's  past is not really mysterious since it's pretty much spelled out for us half way though.  The writing tense and tone also changed about half way as well.  Tess is the protagonist until it abruptly changed from her to Jack. I love when authors give us different perspectives of the same event especially when we can get inside a guy's head, but in this case it just felt awkward.I am thankful that the author gave us a complete, stand alone novel (no cliffhangers here), but it was just okay for me.",2

Was concerned about this one, as we know going in the heroine was an abused girl who continues to make bad choices, choosing to stay with a total loser who draws her into an awful life. But the first 2 books were so good I tried it anyway. I still don't get why she wouldn't let her sister help her? I mean, c'mon, sister who is a lawyer with a wealthy husband...that says safety net to me, not run, run, as fast as you can.But, I read it. My main complaint is that the tone is completely different from the light, sexy, positiveness of the first two books. I like a series to feel consistent. If I enjoyed the first books, I want more of that. While the writing was fine technically, this is the most depressing books I've read in a while. The hero is a cage fighter with a load of guilt on his soul. Which means for penance he ends up in a dirty Louisiana swamp bar.  He's looking out for the heroine. and believe me, she needs help, as she is set firmly on self-destruct.She's a bar maid in said swamp bar, which means she has to put with crap from all the swamp land lowlifes, apparently all of whom are filthy and sweaty and mean. Seriously. Are there no nice people in this book?? I worked in a few bars in college, and most people aren't that bad.

Five years earlier Mac Stryker was his training officer.  Mac is morning the murders of hiswife and daughter and of course becomes a raving alcoholic.  While Jade confronts an violent man in a car, Mac is too drunk to assist.  Jade justifiably kills the man and Mac is booted from the force.  Five years later, their roles are reversed and she is Mac's training officer.  Inthe mean time,someone is sending her boxes of dead flowers, trashing her house and stalking her.

And about another kingdom that bred alpha males and free-loving females. Half the book dwelled on h being such a meek submissive woman because of her upbringing. And goes on and on after the hero captures her, makes her his mate, and gives her confidence. It's basically the story of an abused childhood in the &#34;Middle Ages&#34; period. I put Middle Ages in quotes because the setting of the book is all made up.So the story is H captures h when she was on her way to marry into another kingdom. H finds h to be too timid but falls for her anyway because of course her beauty is unparalleled. h &#34;sacrifices&#34; herself to save her sister and mom. h of course is nonetheless attracted to her captor.And that's one thing that pisses me off when it comes to these kinds of stories of captive falling for captor. I understand Stockholm syndrome. But I don't think it happens overnight.To continue... H chooses h as his mate. And of course in his kingdom, there is only one mate for each man. And it's no simple attraction but a bond. Oh-Kay. Then there's the whole convenient scenario where H, H's brother, and H's sister ends up with the h, h's sister, and h's brother, respectively. So convenient.I say the book is a drag because I can tell you the whole story in less than 5 minutes. I don't know what the author was thinking when she wrote this.

Right now there's a huge uproar in the publishing world with the ease of self-publishing on Kindle and other e-reading devices. The biggest argument against tends to revolve around poor editing and poor formatting, with the naysayers claiming that only the Big 6 publishers could provide ""quality"" e-book editing and formatting, and that they serve as getekeepers of good taste.I pre-ordered this book and got my copy on the day of release. I was appalled at the terrible formatting. Is this the best quality level that a Big 6 publisher like S&S; can manage? Chapter breaks don't appear at new screen clicks, line spacing isn't sufficient at section breaks within a chapter, the dedication line even appears at the end of the story without a line break so it looks like the last line of the story...  Abysmal. Absolutely pathetic. The editing left a bit to be desired as well (and yeah, I've read of enough of King to know when he's being colloquial and when his copy editor goofed up).As for the story, many of the reviewers here have it dead on: if you love your Uncle Stevie (like I do), you'll eat this up. You'll be disturbed by the quick ending and the weak plot device around which it revolves. You'll enjoy the thrills up to that point, but after the let-down ending, you'll start more critically examining the rest and finding more and more to complain about. I enjoyed the story til the ending, but ultimately was left unsatisfied. As far as the gatekeepers of good taste argument above, people have been saying for years that King could publish his laundry list. I've defended against that line for years as a fan. Some of his work wasn't as good as other pieces, but I felt it all had merit. This story starts out well, but doesn't really go anywhere. An editor worth their salt should have told King that and made him reconsider the ending.I hate to leave a bad review for something (I rarely do) and I hate to leave a bad review for an author I like a lot, but the formatting and editing on this story bought my rating down to 2 stars. If it had been better packaged, I might have gone to 3.5 stars for story. Not his best work, but still plenty entertaining. If you are a die hard King fan, you'll read it anyway.

What, the past tense isn't good enough?""If it wasn't [sic - should be weren't] for Vivian, Thomas and RJ, I would have left her earlier in our marriage."" (In our marriage?

Though I received this e-book for free that in no way impacts my review.Dancing with the enemyKrish Dev needs to find a bride--and quick! With a marriage arranged by his father looming, Krish finds the key to his freedom in Maya Shome. But is this dazzling beauty really all she seems...?Maya has only one thing in mind: revenge. But when the host of the most exclusive high society party asks her to dance what is meant to be an innocent tango, it leads to an engagement to Krish--her enemy's son!Arranging their own marriage could work to their advantage...if they can resist mixing business with pleasure!Krish and Maya are entertaining characters, even though they felt a little flat to me. While both had appealing aspects, and they appear to have off-the-charts chemistry, they seemed to be moving on warp-speed through their emotions.It's clear that Krish is a man who expects things his way, for all that he rails against his father's behavior. On the other side of the scale is Maya, with her laser-like focus on her goals in life, or more specifically, her one goal in life. Yet in the brief time they know each other their personalities undergo substantial changes. For me these changes happened far too quickly, lacking a realistic timeline for them to happen within. Plus, they aren't the only characters to undergo radical personality shifts with minimal influence in such a short amount of time.The question Maya faces is if she can let go of the one thing that's kept her moving forward for the past several years. While Krish's issue is how far he's willing to go to get out from under his father's domineering thumb. While they are busy trying to escape their pasts will they be able to see what they have in each other, before it's too late?While an enjoyable romance, I am sorry to say that there was nothing in this book that made it really stand out for me. It seemed to follow the traditional romance formula, just at hyper-speed. That's not to say that it doesn't make for a nice afternoon escape and lift you out of your own concerns and worries.

Instead, he describes what ALL his characters are thinking/feeling/doing from the outside. I read fantasy so I can immerse myself in a tale, and the writing style prevents that utterly.2. Similarly, the characters' emotions are...pretty emotionless, really. They all seem to do a lot of nodding happily and glaring angrily and frowning worriedly. They're flat. There's no nuance.3. The plot is unrealistic. (Even for a fantasy!) When a hooker is beaten up and threatened, are we really supposed to believe that a couple of kids - with absolutely no clue how to use the swords they're carrying - are going to bluff the enormous scary villain? And then said hooker is going to run off with her heroes with no clothes or money...or anything, really, besides adoration in her eyes? It's as treacley as a teenager's daydream. Or how about a young man who finds out his TWIN isn't even related to him? Should we really believe that he's going to burst into heartbroken sobbing (believing it instantly, of course) and then forget all about it two pages later?4. The author isn't great at grammar or punctuation. I started out willing to overlook the poor word usage and the missing commas, but when he started to end declarative sentences with question marks, I gave up. ""I was curious about that"" is not a question! I should not have to explain that to an author!Tell you what: I'll give this book 2 stars because I got it for free and because there's potential there. Buried, but there. The general idea was an interesting one. And should this author get some more practice - and (*ahem*) an editor - I may give his work another shot.",2

Although the book had some action to it, those scenes came off as stilted and not to realistic. I'm thinking this could have been a better book if there was some humor thrown into it, but alas- there was none. One other thing- lay off the exclamation points. A lot of the chapters end with an exclamation point and throughout the book they were thrown in to make the reader think this was an exciting point in the story. If you need an exclamation point to do that, it's not going to work anyways.",2

B00DJW1E92,AM06ZLGNNGNWZ,"09 25, 2013",Amazonilla,More Motivational than Intuitional,"The book has a wonderful cover by Paul Heussenstamnn, which attracted me to the book immediately. Most of the information falls under the paradigm of self-growth and motivation, more than on the psychic development one. Everything in the book is good advice, and it is certainly well-intended. The book reads well, it reads fast, and I love the fact that the author doesn't fill pages with clients' cases. Unfortunately, the book suffers from too many sins to be ignored:- The book gets lost soon after starting. One starts to read and the book is about developing your psychic abilities but then it is about making readings for other people and clients. Developing your intuition and becoming a psychic reader for other people do not equal.- The author repeatedly avoids digging into some matters and explicitly tells you to go and visit her website and take one of her courses or programs. Self-promotion!- There are too many motivational quotes, which add little to the subject of the book. If this wasn't enough, the author quotes herself repeatedly, ad nauseam. How narcissistic and unnecessary is that?- The book, despite its shortness, is quite repetitive.- The reference to quantum and string theory is the usual babble you see repeated everywhere.Physicists themselves say openly that they don't understand or can explain the mechanics of quantum...- I was looking forward to making the exercises in the playbook, ready to forget the narcissistic and simplistic introduction, but, although they are OK, there is nothing that will develop your intuition and psychic ability that much: The exercises are: = Meditation; = writing a gratitude list; = making a list of your fears, worries and doubts to build your confidence; = do some sensorial experiments to notice your five sense via your mind eye, using visualization and imagination; = visit different spaces to experience the energy of the place in your body, and record it. You already know the answer without doing the ""experiment"". If you visit a hospital or your visit your favourite cafe the energy you feel is different. Experiment over. = ""List some elements of laying the proper foundation and setting the stage for effective intuitive information to flow in, through and to you"". = Practice with another person who is not you in a quiet place so you get more experience. Genius! = Write your intentions. = Chart your progress with a given question and the intuition clues you receive. = Journal about your psychic development.The book ends with plenty of more self-promotion about Spagna's other books and his many web sites. A self-promotion pamphlet should be free, and Amazon should raise the standards of self-publishing books on offer.If you are seriously interested in your psychic development buy another book. I like anything by Laura Day and Sherry Dillar, and in a lesser degree Sonia Choquette's books.",2

B007CKQ2KS,A180IE7SJ2QGEF,"06 24, 2013",Reader,Wow this was bad....,"*****Spoiler*****I am very surprised that KA wrote this book.  For the most part all of her H's are very alpha but this H truly was stomach turning.  I really, really hated this guy.  The only other KA H that I hate is the guy in Three Wishes that allowed the h to be slapped by his dad.  I still can't get over that one.  I mean what kind of man would allow that?  Not surprisingly, this H had a lot in common with this one.First off, the H unethically and illegally makes the h sign her life away to him by mind control even though she does not want to be with the H.  Her family gives her no support and instead gives her a guilt trip.  With limited choices, the h ends up being the H's concubines, which essentially is akin to a highly paid mistress.  No matter how much the H argues differently, his treatment of her is so poor that a mistress would actually be a step up from a concubines.  There were very little differences.  The H was married to someone else, expected fidelity from the h but he was not expected to give her the same, she was put up in a nice house, she was expected to be available at his whim, he bought her expensive gifts, she was to behave as he wanted, etc.  The financial compensation that the h receives is the most redeeming quality of this H.  I completely missed the ""sweet"" that the h refers to.  The H manipulates, controls, humiliates and sexually punishes the h continually throughout the book.  I am not referring to the fun kind of punishment.  I actually wondered how the h could stand this guy touching her after the second time he does it.  His treatment of her was so bad that when the H almost kills the h by drinking too much blood, he actually blames the h saying, ""it was your fault"" because she was too excited.  I know, I know...KA h's spine melts every time the H is near and they are usually all talk BUT really?  To blame the h for being almost killed?  Ridiculous.  Is that like, you made me hit you?  Ugh.  How does that show that the H cares about the h or that he felt any remorse over physically hurting the h after she had trusted him after he promised he wouldn't loose control?  There was no remorse after he hurt her with his sexual punishment either.  Supposedly he felt bad but if the h would get a little mouthy then he would threated her with punishing her again.  I crossed from dislike to hate with this H when he went to another woman.  I don't care that he didn't complete a sexual act with the other woman.  The fact that he had her naked and drinking from her was a huge betrayal to me.  The fact that he went to the h right after was just horrible.  This causes the h so much pain that she decides to give in finally breaking the h as was his goal.  The only thing she asks in return is for the H not to call her ""pet"".  ""Pet"" is not only too close to home but the h knew that was what he called the OW as well.  I really pitied the h in that scene and I loathed the H when he did not even give her that to save some of her pride and allow her to heal.  The real kicker of all of this was that after this happens, the h ends up apologizing to the H for saying mean things to him.  Could not believe it.  So basically, it would be ok to treat a person horribly (I'm including almost killing them here too) and then taking them shopping the next day to make amends for all that.  Because the H gives her one day to do whatever he wants after sequestering her and buys her pretty things, he is no longer a selfish d-bag, now he was ""sweet"".  As a female, I am beyond peeved to think that anyone would think that such placation would be acceptable means of making amends for the manner in which the H treated this h.  I have so many issues with the way this h was treated I can go on and on.  I was expecting the H to at least improve but d-bag to the end, he says things to really hurt the h towards the end of the story.  What can I say?  At least the d-bag is consistent.  While the h is contemplating her next move she is attack and decides it is too much and leaves the H.  The glimmer of hope that I had that the H would win me over here was completely decimated when he finds her and instead of having to prove to the h that he loves her, he focuses on the attack, sprinkles an ""I love you"" and panties off, all is well again.  The H didn't even need to break a sweat.  And despite the fact that the H and h are no longer in a paid-mistress-like relationship, in the end, the subservient role that the h would have to endure with him did not make for a HEA for me.  I don't care how many shoes, houses, cars or shinny things this guy would buy.  Being treated like a pet is not worth  all the gold in the world.  She would have been better off if she kept running and finding herself a hot guy that didn't need to feed his ego by humiliating her.Clearly, I didn't enjoy this book.  I will say that this author has some other great stories.  The sequel to this book is much better if you want paranormal and so is Golden Dynasty.  Both are much better than this one.  The only reason I gave this book 2 stars in stead of just 1 is because despite my loathing for the H and the inequitable relationship that was romanced, this author once again develops her characters in an amazingly human manner which makes the readers emotionally invested in the outcome of their fictional existence.",2

B00JXW6GFE,A23IEN5K9JLDTT,"07 11, 2014",Ever  After,What happened to Frankie and Benny's story??,"Sorry, you guys but I'm bummed. My expectations for Frankie and Benny's story were sky-high, and that's on me. I'm very disappointed.I wanted to like this book. I really do. And had this been any other KA book, I would have given this a four but this was Frankie and Benny! I've been waiting for their story ever since At Peace. I thought their story was going to be epic, so I was disheartened when I actually started skimming around 48%.***The Story***After taking the blame for the death of their son and Frankie's boyfriend, Vinnie Jr., Frankie decided she has had enough of the Bianchi family and planned to move to Indiana. For seven long years, the Bianchi family treated her horribly and as penance, Frankie went as far as to take a bullet meant for one of their own. The situation gets even more complicated with the lingering attraction that Frankie felt towards Vinnie's brother Benny.Benny, along with the rest of his family, hated Frankie. They thought she was the reason why Vinnie went to work for his mob boss uncle, Sal. They had cut her out and wanted nothing to do with her. They were downright cruel to her. This was especially hurtful because they were the only normal family that Frankie has ever known. Frankie's own biological family are a bunch of selfish people who were out for themselves. So when the Bianchi family cut her out, she was devastated.***My Thoughts***Before I picked up the book, I re-read parts of At Peace where it was explained why the Bianchi's hated Frankie. That was very clear in At Peace. In fact, Benny called her a bitch to her face in that book. He even thought of her as a 'greedy slut.' The names he called her were horrible. So I was looking forward to how that part was going to be dealt with.Umm, well, it wasn't really dealt with at all. I may have read some 'I'm sorry' in there but after that, nada. Seven years of Frankie taking all those hate from the Bianchi's and not even 20% into the book all are forgiven? Benny basically railroaded her into forgiving him and his family. And Frankie just rolled over and let them walk all over her. Again.She did this with Benny's family and with her own family. The girl has no backbone whatsoever. I felt sorry for her. I wasn't mad at her, I just felt sorry for her. Basically, the whole book was about Frankie bending over backwards to accommodate these people in her life. I'm sorry but I don't want to read about a heroine like that. She was a totally different person from the one we met in At Peace. The only people who really stood up for her were Sal and Gina, and even then she had to let them go because Frankie having a relationship with them would upset Benny and his family.Another part which I didn't like about this book was the long distance thing they had going. It was boring. I could have understood if this part happened before they got together and Benny was doing everything in his power to make her his. But nope. Instead, I have to read about them doing the long distance thing 70% of the book. The thought behind it was great but again, it was boring to read.Benny was okay. I kinda expected him to be like any other KA alpha male.He had his sweet moments but because he didn't really had a chance to fight for Frankie his declarations sounded woefully insincere and inadequate to me.I did like the glimpses we have of Joe, Vi and the girls along with Luke Stark!!

This meant that valuable treatments for suffering patients were refused.  People lay screaming in pain rather than receiving pain medications.  People did not receive adequate medical treatment from trained medical personnel, they received inadequate care from medically untrained sisters and volunteers.  This meant that ones who might have been treated successfully were not.  The book describes her as wanting people to have ""death with dignity"", but her centers did no such thing.Of course, she herself went to hospital and had modern treatments for various illnesses.I'm in no way saying that nobody benefited from her work.

That I finished this book despite my dislikes attests to the author's writing and the story's world.What put me off the book is the heroine's indecisive take on arising issues between her and the hero on the story - always putting it off 'for later consideration' as she puts it. What's worse is her constant hot and then cold to hot again attitude towards the hero who, from the start, told her that he is 100% attracted to her. The attitude was so thinly stretched to me that by 50% of the book it became so old news that I want a new conflict to give the reading journey a fresh breath. It goes on and on until the LAST chapter, and what's more annoying is that she has to be PUSHED by a secondary character to decide. Don't get me wrong, the heroine is decisive as a professional or in her job but it's her emotional hot and cold that ruined the romance in the story for me.And I picked this book because it's listed as ROMANCE and NOT psychology book.The hero himself, though not the usual chest beating alpha male, has a tenderness that coats his inner steel that just melts a woman's heart. I liked him and loved the way the author unveiled his character. I think the author did him justice than the heroine. It was his character that kept me reading and the need to know implied pasts that made him who he is today.The book has funny moments, paragraphs after paragraphs of inner monologue, the main characters chemistry started good - to me, and the whole plot was engaging.Overall, I liked the book and was enjoying it until the heroine's indecisive, hot and cold attitude turns into holier-than-thou attitude soured her character to me.",2

I can understand that consensual regressive therapy could have its benefits. However in this story Angelica is not consensual therefore I think readers need to be made aware there are sexual assault themes in this book.I paid just under $4 USA for a story I read in one night, I thought that was a bit dear. I also felt cheated: there are three themes in this book. One is Angelica and Marshal&#8217;s story. There trust and love for each other takes place over two very short days, most of which Angelica is asleep recovering from one traumatic experience after another.I think the two months Marshal spent living with Nigel and Angelica was suppose to explain the sudden love interest. Personally I would have liked the writer to have started the story with Marshals arrival at the house. All we are told is it was during this time Marshal became aware of Angelica&#8217;s desperate situation and that Nigel is involved with a very dangerous cartel.The story of Jake Eillot is very brief; however he has a major role in the outcome of the book. It would have been nice if the writer had shown the reader through the story his impact on the characters and given us an idea of the sort of person he is.

B00CGFCEHE,ARACFU5SUPKC2,"03 29, 2014",Angie,The Awakening: Aidan,"Aidan is an okay shifter romance. There are parts that I really liked, and some that I really didn't. It started off great! Aidan's best friend, Liam, is caught up in a depression. It's not just depression, but a specific one that male shifters go through when their mate leaves them. Aidan gets into contact with a shifter psychiatrist who specializes in this, but upon meeting her, things go badly. Jaylin awakens the Drall, which basically means she's Aidan's mate and he'll stop at nothing to have her. Unfortunately for him, Jaylin has decided that she will only marry a human man, since she knows just how crippling it can be to lose a shifter mate, for either partner.I loved that set up, and how we learn a lot about shifter romance without info dumps. It's actually happening, and we get to see the start of a bond with Aidan, and what happens when the bond goes badly with Liam. Then it kind of went downhill from there. Liam tricks Jaylin into going on a trip to Cancun, and doesn't let her leave. This is kidnapping! I do like how shifters know who their mates are and pursue them, but Aidan goes too far. Plus, Liam needs help, so not only does his best friend leave him, but takes the doctor, too! Sure, he set him up with another one (over Skype), but still. Way to be a good friend.While this plot annoyed me, what most bothered me about Aidan was how everyone spoke like these events were happening over weeks, months, or even years. The word choices were just really bad, since Aidan kidnaps Jaylin after just a few days of meeting her. Then they send three or four days in Cancun, and yet he has spent &#34;weeks&#34; trying to convince her that they're meant to be. And there's a few mentions of it being &#34;so long&#34; but no, it's a few days! I can get behind instalove when there's a reason for it, but don't act like it's been longer than it has been.Aidan just didn't work for me for the most part.

Well, she thought her marriage was happy until one day she catches her husband, Charlie, with the neighbor. In that instant her whole life falls apart. But, she doesn't confront him. She doesn't let him know she saw him. Okay I get it, I wish she would have, but she's in shock, she wants to decide what to do and find out all of the facts before telling him she knows. So I wait...Lily makes an appointment for a consultation with sexy divorce attorney, Eli, to see what her options are. Over the next few weeks (Yes *exasperated sigh* she goes on for months living at that house like nothing is wrong, gathering evidence, and trying to make enough money to leave)Lily and Eli build a friendship and some sexual tension while Lily does some office work to pay off her legal fees. Still waiting...While at the salon, trying to become a desirable woman again instead of a harried housewife, Lily meets an older woman who offers her the answer to all of her money problems. You know, just a little prostitution. Why Lily thought she would lose everything in the divorce I have no idea. Charlie makes six figures, they have a nice house, cars, no prenup, and she has evidence of his indiscretions. I get that she didn't want ""Charlie's money"" but hooking is really the only option? Still waiting...Well, she gave it a go and was terrible at it and I saw that twist coming from a mile away. Plus, now she can no longer take the moral high ground because she, too, is a cheater. I kept reading because I was sure Lily's confrontation with Charlie was going to be epic. Wrong. It didn't happen until the end and there was little drama. Maybe I took this book too seriously.

The story is a take on the Millennial Kingdom and how good and evil will battle before the King returns. I liked the death walkers the most, and enjoyed the inclusion of dragons. The main character is what is called a ""wraith dancer,"" which is a cool idea. Wraith Dancers are women assassins chosen to defend and kill with Gifts of Transcendence which allow them to do such things as make pin-point assaults that can kill with a touch, and increase their agility and senses in battle. The idea of cities lain to waste so that technology has devolved was also interesting, and one of my favorite collection of scenes shows them visiting these ancient cities - now wastelands because of how fragile they are not having been kept up.The reason why I gave this 2 out of 5 stars is because I was often uninterested in the character's plight and felt many scenes could have been cut. Originally I gave it 3 stars, but the truth is I didn't enjoy reading it. I think he has some great ideas, but the pacing needs polishing. The first 30 percent of the book could use major compaction. All the set up to show that Gwen has doubts about her service to the Serpent Kings might have been shown on her way to meet the dragon Belial. That would have been a great opening scene. If it started there I would have been much more enthusiastic about going forward. There is action in the first 30%, but it seems only for action sake, not because it was necessary for setting up the story. In studying the philosophy of including a twist in every scene, I really noticed the scenes in this book that just...ended. Putting a twist on the end of scenes really pushes a reader forward, and the places where this lacked in James' book made it easy to put the book down. A good editor's touch could make this book great, but as it stands I just see too much that could be taken out without much consequence.James provided a free copy for review under the promise that I read the whole book and provide an honest review.",2

Books.,"HLB reviews Find Her, Keep Her","So I liked the kind of premise for this book, or rather there were a lot of little elements that I thought would be interesting in a story. First of the main character, Daisy, is a travel writer (and who doesn't want to be a travel writer), who is reeling from a terrible betrayal/breakup between her now ex and would-be best friend. So what does she do, she leaves town. I liked the idea of kind of getting away and throwing yourself into work after a bad breakup.So Daisy gets to Martha's Vineyard and basically almost immediately runs into this guy, Belmont. He invites her to a party. She blows him off. He happens to be at the grocery store she is at, they have a cute little connection, and the before you know it he's like making out with her. At his birthday party, it honestly kind of seems like Belmont's brother ruffies Daisy, but it is never really address, and just felt weird.After the party Belmont and Daisy becoming inseparable. Like having sex all the time, all over the place. It reaches the level of being completely unbelievable because it's literally all they do. Have sex, two lines of dialogue, sex, move into the bathroom, more sex, drive for five minutes, sex, sleep, sex, it's just like seriously? There is no real emotional connection between them and it's just truly bizarre.And then the ex shows up with the ex-best friend (understandable and expected plot development), but then at dinner the ex-best friend reveals Belmont is a &#34;gigolo&#34;. It was like seriously bizarre and weird. And of course, it turns out everyone but Daisy knows he is a gigolo, or was a gigolo. And everyone is cool with it, like even Daisy's mom. It was just so strange.Also about half way through the book the author's voice for Daisy kind of changes. Suddenly Daisy starts to sound much more immature then she did at the beginning of the book, even her phrasing became more naive and immature. The book definitely had potential, and I really wanted to like it, but it just did not come together.",2

The first time I read the word ""t*tty"" (not sure if Amazon will allow me to write the word), I was turned off.  By the tenth time, and after a mention of a ""c*m shot"" (I'm CERTAIN they won't allow me to write that!), I had to verify whether the book was written by a woman.  If I didn't know better, I would have guessed that this was porn for men written by a man.  I don't mean this as an offense to male readers or writers, but erotica for women has a finesse, for lack of a better word, that male erotica/porn typically does not.

B007CLQIHY,A3ABXZGEHEC61W,"10 5, 2012",Eldon J. Stracke II,A style with potential.,"Although I enjoyed the storytelling, I found it difficult to feel for the characters; it seemed the darker players received most of the development, and that was broken constantly by plot progression that took one step back for every two forward (i.e., frequently having to read through a narration a second time from a different perspective).  I understand the point of the story was the alien incursion, but it never seemed a primary plotline... just a side-event filling in gaps here and there.The ending was disappointing, as well; I understand the intention of a planned sequel; I just do not feel there was enough character resolution or plot advancement to warrant the author's choice of breaking point.Finally, I have to mention that the United Stated Army does nor use, not have they ever used, ""Hummers"".  A Hummer is a civilian vehicle designed to fulfill the suburban-American need to compensate.  The Army uses the HMMWV, which is vocalized as `Humvee'.  Soldiers slanged it down a bit with `hummer' (lower case), which in turn became the brand name of a General Motors SUV that would be hard pressed to survive 24 hours as a military field vehicle.I'm also an IT professional, and would like to see the author include more in that area in his future works.

B00B5N35JY,A34CLUILHA2MTC,"07 25, 2013",PraxJarvin,Decent story hampered by poor characterization,"The story follows the age old conceit of seeing what life is like in another time/universe. Ace and the Doctor get zapped into a dimension where bad guys are good guys and no one but the Doctor and Ace remember. The moral of the story would seem to be that we shouldn't be prejudiced but that never really comes to fruition and as such it leaves the Doctor looking like a guy who can not accept that things change. As portrayed here, we get a Doctor that's not so much Seven but more Two and Eleven mashed together. It feels off and he never comes across as the Seventh Doctor of the TV show, and no where near the dark manipulator of the books or audios. Ace feels tone deaf. The writer knew all the elements of Ace - baseball bat, ghetto blaster, jacket, nitro nine - but had no idea how to make the character feel like Ace outside of surface details. As well, the character feels especially young and naive. (Fans wishing to figure out a continuity placement for this story should note that it seems to hew close &#34;Remembrance&#34; and &#34;Silver Nemesis&#34; and relies on Ace not knowing much about the Doctor or about the wider universe.)Lastly, the story covers a similar tack as that of the Seventh Doctor Story, &#34;Shockwave&#34; from Big Finish and AudioGo's 50th Anniversary Audibook Series. Both feature Ace befriending a young girl whose fate she and the Doctor interfere with. The audiostory does this in a devastating way, the book seems almost nonchalant.",2

B00IW8ADMW,AHFKFSBQJGO0R,"06 14, 2014",Christina,Promising storyline that falls flat,"Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.I hate writing less than stellar reviews, I really do. I understand the blood, sweat, and tears that go into writing a book and I respect that. Even when I have to leave a review that isn&#8217;t &#8220;good&#8221;, I try to be as constructive as possible so that the author can hopefully understand why certain aspects of their work didn&#8217;t work for me. It&#8217;s never personal, not in the least. As a reviewer, authors ask us for honest reviews, and that is exactly what I intend to provide.I have to begin by saying that the number of times cheating is mentioned, not only by the sailors but their spouses as well, is offensive. &#8220;He harbored some f'd up fantasy that he&#8217;d find a girl to be faithful to him when he was away.&#8221; Unfortunately, Ms. Albertson&#8217;s generalization only serves to propagate the stereotype of the Navy family and a penchant for infidelity. Do sailors and their spouses cheat? Of course, but so does the civilian population. Cheaters are the exception, not the rule. Given the fact that the hero, Patrick, quotes the SEAL code over and over, he seems to play fast and loose with his personal morals. Unfortunately it is just the kind of relationship that Ms. Albertson has established between Patrick and Annie that falls victim to the divorce rate of Navy families; couples that rush into marriage, knowing very little about each other.I usually make it a policy to avoid books with military storylines, especially Navy. It&#8217;s like my husband watching Crimson Tide or JAG, it&#8217;s hard not to point out every technical inaccuracy. What prompted me to pick up Invincible I&#8217;m not sure, however it only further proves I need to stay away from books such as this. Sailors wear uniforms, not outfits. There is a clear lack of understanding of how advancement works such as Annie&#8217;s father&#8230;he retired as a lieutenant, yet he went to the US Naval Academy. In order to have retired, having put in at least 20 years, he had to have been the world&#8217;s worst sailor. Ships tie up to piers, not docks. My eyes nearly rolled out of my head at the speed in which Patrick was able to secure family housing. Getting base housing that quickly is tantamount to the Immaculate Conception. It is possible to go an entire tour of 2-3 years and still be on the waiting list. Sailors walk down gangplanks, not planks. And non-deployable for three years? There is rarely such thing as &#8220;non-deployable&#8221;, unless the member is NPQ (not physically qualified). The &#8220;needs of the Navy&#8221; are met, regardless of your status of sea or shore billet. You go where they tell you to go (trust me on this one, our first shore tour was interrupted by an all expenses paid vacation for my husband to Iraq.)My biggest issue with the book is the lack of research that went into it to make it genuine and believable. The book is relatively short. It seems that plot-wise, Ms. Albertson took several shortcuts in order to make the story neat and tidy, rather than doing the research to make it believable. This isn&#8217;t Finnegan&#8217;s Wake or War and Peace. It isn&#8217;t a 600+ page epic length novel that needed to be pared down in order to make it readable. &#8220;We&#8217;d docked at the SEAL base in Coronado so we wouldn&#8217;t be hassled by customs and immigration&#8221;, guess what? NOT. GOING. TO. HAPPEN. As the holder of a DOD ID card, two passports and state issued ID, I could not get to that pier, much less an unauthorized boat carrying undocumented individuals. Yes, it&#8217;s quick and easy, however it&#8217;s not believable in the least. Had Ms. Albertson explored other avenues in which Patrick had to smuggle Annie and her son back into the country, it not only would have made it more believable, but would have made for a more compelling story as well. &#8220;And we sure as hell didn&#8217;t leave our careers to chase women across the world. Most of the authors who wrote that crap had never even met a SEAL, let alone been f'd by one.&#8221; Unfortunately, that statement right there sums up the majority of the problems with the book; however substitute &#8220;f'd by one&#8221; with &#8220;even spoke with one.&#8221;Once Patrick and his crew decide to rescue Annie, he sets in motion a plan to return to Aruba after the ship docks back in San Diego. In the real world, when arriving back in port they cannot turn around and take a flight back into Aruba. There is something called &#8220;country clearance&#8221; which must be provided by the command. This is done to assure the safety of the sailor based on any threats that might be present in a given location. This takes at minimum 30 days to secure. In the book, it&#8217;s about two weeks and this isn&#8217;t even mentioned. This policy could have actually worked to Ms. Albertson&#8217;s advantage in crafting Patrick&#8217;s plan to rescue Annie.There are entirely too many conflicting thoughts on both Annie and Patrick&#8217;s part. Annie says, &#8220;Despite the fact you&#8217;d just paid a h---er to give you a b---job, I could tell you were a good man.&#8221; Yet just a little while later &#8220;Why did I believe him? This was a man who paid for sex in a w---house.&#8221; Patrick meanwhile is quoting the SEAL code left and right, talking about how his mother raised him to respect women yet he says things like, &#8220;What the f? What kind of con was this heroin-addicted w---e trying to pull on me? This b---h wanted me to believe she was a sex-trafficked American?&#8221;The depiction of Kyle, Patrick&#8217;s DIVO, or division officer is a caricature of a Naval officer. Let&#8217;s not even get into the matter of fraternization, but there are several instances where Kyle is pushing the boundaries of conduct unbecoming. Patrick also continues to insist that going to Captain&#8217;s Mast could possibly be the end of his career, however facing NJP (non-judicial punishment) at mast would be child&#8217;s play compared to being charged under the UCMJ (uniform code of military justice) for going rogue where he might find himself with an all expenses paid trip to Leavenworth. If Patrick were to go to mast, it&#8217;s his DIVO Kyle that would likely take a bulk of the heat.I had trouble connecting with any of the characters. Both Annie and Patrick seemed superficial. There was too much back and forth angst &#8216;loves me, loves me not&#8217; going on to make their connection believable. It felt forced.Again, I hate having to write reviews such as this, but I think it would be a disservice to the author, much less the reader to mislead them with this book. The story itself was an interesting idea, however the lack of basic research that went into workings of the Navy is troubling. The technical inaccuracies were distracting. Perhaps for the lay reader they may not be, but I could not get past them in order to get any enjoyment out of the book. For me, Invincible is a 2-2  star read. I believe it has the ability to be a much better story if Ms. Albertson were to again revamp it with more technical accuracy to make it believable. I can suspend belief with the best of them, but this crosses the realm into fantasy, which is obviously not the intention. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t think this is a series I can continue with.",2

The YA category is older than the age that should read this book.Good idea and different which is always good.Book needs polishing concerning the typos and some changes must be made to match previous statements so it's not contradictory.In book one, Renee's latest adoptive father (the attorney) ALWAYS has a whole wheat bagel in the mornings and the author makes a big deal of letting the reader know he's pretty anal about his routine, but in the excerpt from book two, it turns into a whole wheat muffin.Even middle school kids are bright and will catch this discrepancy.A few of the analogies are pretty silly such as ""like two hyperactive rattlesnakes doing the salsa"" and ""a skinned raccoon in Sunday's soup.""C'mon.In an excerpt from book two, Renee allows herself to simply walk off with some stranger in a Darth Vader costume after a death threat the night before, her private investigator thinking her situation bad enough to take a position as her sub gym teacher and an entire book one of cycling and going through hell.  You'd think she'd be apprehensive.  Nope.  Walked right off with some guy.Then, the private detective can't manage a couple of gun shots to even hit the car driving away, but Sam somehow managed to smack the Darth Vader guy in the face with a football when he'd never even picked up a football before, let alone throw one before that day.  He had no practice and only one lesson lasting a couple of minutes at best.  Too far fetched and completely unbelievable.It was easy for me to catch these things and kids are smart.  They'll catch it as well.I like the originality of the story however.  Refreshing to see something different besides the teenage vampire guy and the wholesome mousy girl he likes.",2

Drake finds clues throughout the book without telling the reader what they are.  The author should try reading Agatha Christie, who lays out the clues all the way through her books but the reader still cannot find the culprit.

B0090NKCXS,A2VXSQHJWZAQGY,"12 26, 2013",Sandy Milan,Awful except for the excellent third book - 2.5 stars,"It took me almost a year to finish this Trilogy. I read the first book 'Violet' in January of this year but I really disliked it and couldn't bring myself to read the next one 'Lily' until now. I decided to immediately the last one 'Rose' just so I could finish the set and delete it from my Kindle. I have individually reviewed each book here and would recommend that anyone interested in reading this boxed set, should go and read the 1 and 2 star reviews under each book individually here on Amazon before buying it. There are way too many positive reviews for this boxed set for it to be credible.+++Spoilers+++Violet - Book 1Taken from my original review of the book in January 2013:I finished this book yesterday and even after a day I'm still irritated by the h's attitude. Again considering the time period, I found the h's attitude very 21st century. We are told constantly how 'different' her family is and how her mother just wants her to have a love match. I sincerely doubt that any parent of the day would have gone to such trouble to get their daughter alone with a young, handsome and eligible male and expect for them to sleep together.Inevitably the h sleeps with the H but refuses to marry him. Of course the thought of pregnancy never enters her mind (although later it does). The fact that she continually doubted the H's love for her, and he professed it quickly, and if I were him I would have found someone more deserving. The h believed that all the H was interested in was her money and it made her seem shallow and completely unlikable.The book is a 'modern' historical filled with modern attitudes.Lily - Book 2I had hoped this would be an improvement since I disliked the first book so much. I disliked it more in some ways than I did the first book. The H had seen the h four years earlier but she was too young for him at the time. They meet again when he comes to the baptism of his friend's twins, who are the h's nieces. They continue their relationship but the h promises her second sister that she won't go after the H because her sister wants him. Ridiculous, nonsensical promise which is of course a distraction. The H starts off thinking that he doesn't want to be married but then later decides he loves the h and he then proposes and the h accepts, despite the h's sister being thoroughly miserable about it. I already hate the sister and she is the forthcoming h in the final book of the trilogy.So now the H and h are happily betrothed and planning their wedding when the h's older brother dies making him an heir to a title. He returns home with the h where his father, a Marquess, immediately rejects his betrothal saying he has to marry his late brother's fiancee. The other woman doesn't want to marry him because she is in love with the man who killed her late fiancee and she is pregnant with his child. The Marquess blackmails the other woman and the H into getting married in order to save the father of her child. OMG I just couldn't take anymore of this cr*p. No one stands up to the Marquess, the H starts saying he'll protect the other woman's child and acknowledge it. He becomes all wimpy and beta. The h is the only one trying to work out a way for them to be together. What a stupid mess of a story. The modernity of the book also freaked me out because of course there is no way for the H to have gotten out of his betrothal to the H so easily and then be marrying the other woman just one week later.I forgot one other massively creepy factor to this book. The h is besotted with animals and rescuing them, which isn't a problem. However the first night she and the H sleep together, they have an audience of her pets. He is freaked out by this but the h keeps saying that it isn't a problem. The second time they sleep together, the H locks the animals out but they keep interrupting by scratching on the door etc. I am not kidding you. Read this book at your own risk.Rose - Book 3I read this book immediately after finishing the second because I want to delete this boxed set. I already strongly disliked the h because of her selfish, ridiculous behaviour in the second book and I doubted the author had any ability to redeem her in my eyes. She only wanted to marry a title and wasn't interested in the H because he is a commoner.And didn't I get a pleasant surprise. The last book is by far the best and a very good story. The h is shallow, selfish and unlikeable in book 2 and at the beginning of this book. She goes on a journey, literally with her mother to court, but also on one of self-discovery. I loved it honestly. This book was way more romantic than the other 2 and I loved the way the H and h talked to each other. I loved the H's incredible integrity and I loved the way he insisted on more from the h. I loved the way he wouldn't give her more physically until she wanted all of him. The thing preventing this book from the magical 5 stars is once again the modern behaviour of the characters. I love the time period that the author set these books in but very often the sisters behaved and spoke just like modern women today. Interestingly I did enjoy the history aspects of this book very much, obviously the author did a lot of research into the court of King Charles. I definitely can recommend this final book in the trilogy. It's a pity you probably have to read the other 2 before you can read this one else you won't know what's going on.",2

B006IS4QKI,AYZ3XI8VSE6C1,"12 22, 2011",Rare Reviewer,This is Why I don't buy Anthologies!,"I usually don't buy Anthologies because usually you're lucky to get 1 good story out of the entire book.  In the recent past, I purchased the anthology SUPERNATURAL for $5.24 and enjoyed all 4 stories so I thought I would give it a try again.I'm sorry that I did so because there are too many stories for the size of the book and that affected the development of each story.  I guess that it's just to give a reader a taste of the writing style of the authors but it really does not do a good job of that.  The reader still does not know if the author has the talent for developing characters, plot lines and action scenes that will draw you in to the story even if the story is a full length novel.The bottom line is that while some of the stories were able to overcome - somewhat - the lack of length, they all are under-developed.  An under-developed story is still an under-developed story.  There are 99 cents buy that are a better bargain so that makes none of these worth over a $1 a piece.  I gave this a 2 star rating because now I know after Volume 1 - I don't want to waste money on any more volumes.****SPOILERS ALERT*******The Addiction by Jaid Black was a narrative about John Calder (cultured pimp) and Shelli Rodgers (inept virgin stripper).  She has sex with him because he seems so lonely to her, he dumps her the next day because he's not good enough for her, and shows back up a year later to tell her he loves her, because after all Shelli did make him laugh because of her terrible strip act, and finds out that they have a baby from the one night stand they had.  Immediately they both declare their love for each other - THE END.  Just did not feel the love and seemed rather stupid.**END OF SPOILER**Captain of Nara's Heart by Laurann Dohner was actually one of the best of the six.  While it was short like the others, the author was able to develop the characters and actions more.  It was more show by dialogues and actions than just relating a tale.  The short story was a good indicator of what the author is capable of but still a few more chapters would have made this a more enjoyable story.Dangerous Addiction by Desiree Holt was the next best story and an indicator of how ""HOT"" Holt's works can be but again it was too short to make things believable.Highland Tryst by Eliza Knight just did not draw me in at all.  Everything was too contrived.  Way to short for any type of development and I'm not even sure that I would be interested in any of her longer stories.Tattoo Witch by Kathy Kulig was not too bad and had a lot of sex in the very short story but nothing to really draw me in to care.  Unique plot line with a paranormal twist.Dragon Heat by Mel Teshco was another too short good story.  The author was able to develop her characters more but had to throw in a lot of actions scenes to get to the quick end.",2

I loved the 1st book ""Wanted"", and was quite disappointed when it ended so suddenly!  So I had to buy the sequel. I wish I hadn't.  Totally ruined it for me.To start, there were so many typos/grammatical errors, and sentences that just didn't make sense (or words were out of order, what's with that?). Yes, there were a few in the 1st book, but this seemed very sloppy in comparison.  Did the author hurry this out in response to the popularity of the 1st?Second, the characters all underwent personality changes! I can understand why Carl did, brain damage and all, but Jessie went from being a relatively strong, capable woman in ""Wanted"" to a weak, simpering, needy annoyance in ""Ice Princess"". I liked her in the 1st book, hated her in the 2nd.  Dustin wasn't even in this book other than a few mentions, but he ends up being the bad guy? I'm not going to complain about Carl, because with brain damage you expect personality changes, but I did not like him in this book.  And Tanya lived up to the title of the book.I didn't like the addition of new characters either. I expected more focus on Tanya and Jessie, but Sarah was more of the focus, and I tried to like her, but she grated on my nerves as well.Also, it was so short! Under 3000 locations. After ""Wanted"" being a full-length novel (and free, and fantastic!), this was such a disappointment. If there was a 3rd book, I would not buy it. So disappointed.",2

Furthermore this one carries the author's liberty too far in quite a few erroneous milestones e.g. the hero is foreseen as an observer in the Franco-Prussian War after the campaign against the Native Americans in 1876.

I was expecting so much more from this book and it just fell short of expectation. I was anticipating some thrilling action scenes and a dramatic build up to the stand off between the Marker and Jay. A majority of this book was filled with repetitive love scenes and an anticlimactic &#34;duel&#34; (if you can even call it that) that ended before it even began. I had such high hopes, but unfortunately when too much sex is used as a filler for a plot there's not much you can do. One thing that really bothered the shit out of me was that the author was constantly misspelling Naomi's (Lily's friend) name! Sometimes on the same page..shit sometimes in the same paragraph! I kept wondering how it was possible to miss it when only a sentence before you'd been calling her Naomi and then immediately after spelling it Noami. If it were just a few times I'd have been able to get over it but I counted at least 10! Furthermore, Ariana's (or was it adriana?) actions with Jay so soon after what had happened to her were just completely unrealistic. I don't know how it would be possible for someone to do that so soon after what was done to her. It just didn't make sense to me.The epilogue was the only thing that I really liked. Oh, and the fact that a problem I had with the first book was addressed (albeit briefly) early on in the book. The fact that he had flirted and danced with her in front of Lily at the club had really rubbed me the wrong way in the first book. While I guess the explanation made sense I wish he had told Lily about it. Also, I'm sure there were better ways to do it than being a total pig.",2

There is so much 'other' stuff that the mystery part is poorly defined. Sorry, but you need to work on this book some and start by defining the mystery better and not hiding it among book trivia or filler.Now to let you all know, I have been reading avidly since I was 8 (65 now) and have never read a book where I was actually concentrating on the book and still did not know what was going on. This is what the disorganization, for lack of a better term, of this book does to people.So, I think the author has to eliminate the trivia and beef up the mystery details more.

Or was it the sanity of the Governess that was the problem?I struggled with this book. It was difficult to read, with long sentences which didn't make a lot of sense at times.

Much of this book is also taken up by lists - pages of them - of links you could, once again, find yourself with a search engine and a few minutes, free. There&#8217;s nothing earth-shattering or even original here. The sum total of the advice is how to find out which books sell the best and then &#8216;assemble&#8217; Kindle books to match those categories. And I mean assemble, not write: the author advises that you find other peoples&#8217; recipes, etc., or hire a ghostwriter or essay-writer, then just stick the parts together. If you are an author who writes about what you are passionate about, what you are motivated to write about, if you write those things that teem in your imagination in order to share your worlds with readers - this book is not for you. And I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re not going to find out anything you couldn&#8217;t easily find out by perusing the Goodreads forums or the KDP forums.

At certain points I was close to not finishing the story, hence the skimming just so I could get it over with.

So one is forced to read about the Riss discrimination whinefest once again for over half the book. Book 2 is effectively Book-1 once again with a new ship and worse officers.Sidenote: Personally, I find it extremely doubtful that professional, military officers belonging to a space-navy are ever going to act in such a revolting manner to a peer officer considering that the only real physical distinguishing characteristic of Nadya from ordinary humans is her facial tattoo. Now, if you gave her a tail or horns, I could understand the ick factor..but a simple tattoo just doesn't cut it.I continued to plough my way through but the epic facepalm moment happens at the end when the Raider base is discovered and the SaS Navy high command spends weeks building up a flotilla without sending a ship to scout the base and its defenses.

Her father was murdered to protect her from having the same fate, and she was sent into a witness protection program where she was shuffled around for years. Now she is a broken person with no past and no future. She uses drugs and random hook-ups to numb the pain, but she never lets anyone into her life until someone from her forgotten past shows up.Tristan never forgot the girl he loved all his life. They were best friends growing up and eventually they became more, but when they were 14 she moved away. Shortly after that she was supposedly murdered and it broke a part of Tristan. He was never fully able to get over Mackenzie, and he made a lot of life altering decisions because of the grief. Now year&#8217;s later fate brings Mackenzie back into his life, but she goes by Josie now and she is a completely different girl then he remembers.Josie was a very hard character for me to relate too. She had given up on life and was really just a shell of a person. I get that she had crappy things happen to her, but she just came across as really weak to me. She was given opportunities to change her life, but she was too afraid to even try. As time went on she did get better, but for most of the story I really wasn&#8217;t a big fan of her.I am very torn on how I feel about Tristan. I liked that he had a photographic memory and said awkward things all the time. It made him endearing and sweet. But I hated how someone so smart could make such stupid life decisions. I realize that people do this in real life, but it frustrates me then too, so I really didn&#8217;t like that about him. For the most part I did like Tristan, he just had some majorly annoying flaws.I actually really enjoyed the first few chapters in this book, but after that it pretty much completely fell apart for me. My biggest issue was that there were way too many POV&#8217;s. I found that I didn&#8217;t care about half the characters and when I would come to one of their parts, I would just skim through it because I wasn&#8217;t really all that interested in them. Second, everything felt really unrealistic to me, and very over-dramatic. Because of this, I felt a huge disconnect with the story. Overall, this was a really rough read for me, but if the synopsis sounds promising to you, then go ahead and give it a try. Hopefully you have a better experience then I did.Notable Scene:She gasped as he ripped off his hooded sweatshirt and threw it to the ground. Brilliant inked images covered his arms, interrupted only by the white beater that molded to his body. He slammed his forehead into the wall and then landed punch after punch. His blood painted the bricks and Josie knew a part of him would die here this night.She sat stone-faced, her gaze fixed on the raging figure below. She was envious of such a physical kind of anger. She had never unleashed her fury that way and wondered if it would do any good. His chest heaved in a quick cadence, and Josie fought hard to keep her own breath even.In that moment, the moon broke through the clouds and cast a blanket of silvery light over the alley. He froze, mesmerized by the grid-pattern shadows created by the fire escape. His eyes traveled up the shadow as if  navigating a labyrinth, until a small, solid shape obstructed the path. He looked up, catching her.The pencil slipped from Josie&#8217;s grip, rolling and falling over the edge. As connected as she felt to the lead and wood, she did not watch it drop. Instead, she stared down into the face of something so familiar&#8212;heartache.She&#8217;d never seen such a beautiful, broken expression, and it took her breath away. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she registered the soft tap, tap, tap of the pencil hitting the ground.Josie felt bound to him in that moment. They were two souls snared by chance and circumstance. Though they did not feel like strangers.FTC Advisory: St. Martin&#8217;s Griffin/Macmillan provided me with a copy of Beautiful Addictions.

B008NZQ332,AH3W1BMSY9G07,"04 24, 2013",Lovemuffins,First Book By This Author That I Could Barely Finish,"Okay... I pushed my way through the preachiness in the second Dancing Moon Ranch book with Sophie's mom and I've liked all the other Dancing Moon books so far and have written reviews about how much I like them... I wish I could have with this one because I was so excited to read about Ricky and Sophie's story finally.The preaching has gotten ridiculous.Apparently anyone involved in BDSM must be mentally ill and the reason Ricky's mom left Sam was because of that and now she sleeps around a lot and of course her slutty behavior is because of the mental ill thing that goes along with BDSM.Sophie finds out that her mom slept her way to the top of the corporate ladder and she lashes out pretty extremely - not entirely surprisingly considering how much she was lectured on modesty, etc. while she was a child, her parents hiding all the reasons WHY she wasn't allowed to get any life experiences with boys and had to go to all girl schools and is basically completely unprepared for the world of dating. And instead of ANY character seeing this as reasonable, that she's doing a major rebellion, Sam starts saying that she might be mentally unstable, they're asking Ricky if he really wants to be with a woman who goes crazy when she hits a roadblock... um... SERIOUSLY? And of course Rick is apparently beyond perfection when it comes to not sleeping around, etc.Yeah. This is totally believable, not at all preach-y, and super romantic that he'd be willing to ""look past"" her ""crazy"" rebellion and ""instability"" and end up loving and marrying her anyway. So she has one bad night where she completely rebels and then BOOM, Rick is disgusted with her and thinks less of her and has to ""get over"" that. I can't even say how angry this made me.  At least the other ""heroes"" in this series had a little humanity, they'd been with other women, they had life experience and there were children that were causing a lot of the conflict. Rick has none of those excuses other than being a prissy jerk.Sophie even makes a fantastic point to him saying ""Then according to you, because of one incident at a party, I'm suddenly relegated to unmarriageable status."" Instead of realizing what a close-minded, unsympathetic, unempathetic jerk he's going, Ricky tells her that that incident was a ""warning sign.""  Unfortunately because the author is apparently trying to send some kind of message, Sophie eventually starts to think that her reaction was ridiculous, rather than the way her parents handled her raising since it's pretty much their fault they didn't raise her to realize that 1. boys and girls can hang out together without having sex and 2. that you can have sex before marriage and still be a ""decent"" person. Which is why she thought Justine was no longer decent when Sophie realized that she'd had pre-marital sex. But that wouldn't get across the message that the author apparently wants to preach.Is Sophie being selfish? Does she need to apologize to Justine? Yes. Absolutely. But her reaction isn't over the top and it sure as heck isn't a ""warning sign."" Ugh. Also... it would have been nice if her parents had apologized to her too. Since they pretty much messed her up in the head. But of course they didn't because again... wouldn't go with the ""message.""But if you're a guy, don't worry. Apparently men can have sex, although Rick says it wasn't ""recreational,"" it was just satisfying a mutual need. I have a heads up for the author - that makes it recreational whether you're a man or a woman and Rick comes across as a major hypocrite. And when he does finally get it on with Sophie, he tells her it's just sex and just a physical need and it's a wonder that she doesn't end up feeling like a tramp for the way that he treats her. But no, she just feels sad and rejected.Now... other than all of that, the writing is well-done as usual, I'm happy that Sophie and Rick get a HEA, and the best part of the book was Marc finally finding out the truth.  As always, Ms. Watters does a fine job when handling the tough emotional stuff. Which is why it's so distressing when she crams in the unnecessary judgmental drama to get some ""message"" across, because it's trite and takes away from the really good stuff that's going on otherwise. The only reason I managed to even make it through this book was because I was hoping that eventually Rick would come around and realize how ridiculous he'd acted, apologize, make everyone else realize how ridiculous and judgmental they were being... yeah it never happened. Instead Sophie realized how close she'd become to being a ""bad woman"" and let hypoc-Rick make her feel ashamed that she fell off the wagon one night and had her major rebellion.  Personally I thought she pulled herself together really well afterwards until the shaming started.I'm going to try one more of these books because other than Justine's and Sophie's story I want to know what happens with the kids, especially Marc. I just really hope the preaching is done because it completely takes away from the enjoyability of the story.",2

So suffice it to say that the author offers up a ridiculous, unbelievable cockamamie theory to explain all the bizarre events that happen that has more holes in it than a sieve.  Anyone with any education in the sciences or health fields will tell you this couldn't happen. She continues to throw out more little unexplained bits clear to the end.

This isn't the first book I've read by Sharon Page and honestly, that's a good thing because if it had been I most likely wouldn't read any more.  I had to force myself to finish, which is really unusual for me.  The writing was very hard to stay with because it was so choppy and stunted.  It's hard to put into words, there was just no flow in the writing.  From sentence to sentence and paragraph to paragraph it just didn't flow together into one cohesive piece of work.  The female lead was hard to like, she was so one dimensional and immature.  The idea that she was a single working mother should have been able to evoke some feelings for her but her attitude and behavior just negated any positives.  The men were just as bad.  There was just no depth to grasp on to.  The only bright point in the book started around 76 or 78 percent but only lasted for short time.  The suspense should have had me at the edge of my seat, it was a good story line, it just wasn't well developed or put together.  I did enjoy that The Master of the Island had a bit of a bigger roll in this one, he was the most intriguing character in the book and the one that evoked feelings.I also have to note that this installment of the Invitation to Eden books should be read before the Suzanne Rock Hydrotherapy book even though it appears from the website that it should follow because there are characters in this one that had things occur in the other that would prevent them being in a book that was following so that was really annoying as well.Overall I have to say, if this had been my introduction to Sharon Page's writing it would have also been the conclusion.",2

B00B7VP6BY,A3AM7V4Y1BI1DK,"07 18, 2014",Janell Sutherland,Superficial time traveler thinks being old is gross,"In this story, aspiring model Kelli describes herself as &#8220;tall, slim, with glossy black hair and a well-proportioned face.&#8221; She&#8217;s just about to turn twenty-five, she has a hot boyfriend who is about to propose, and she&#8217;s very superficial. She goes to bed on the eve of her birthday and wakes up on her fiftieth birthday, married to &#8220;chubby-no-friends William McSnelly.&#8221; Her name is now Kelli McSnelly. It is the worst.Old Kelli spends a lot of time staring at her newly old body, and she is not a fan. She sees flab, sag, wrinkles, gray hair, and sun damage, a dilapidated state overall, and she is disgusted. Now, I am personally closer in age to fifty than I am to twenty-five, and my body is far from a dilapidated state, if I may say so. I didn&#8217;t think Kelli would have been in that bad of shape, so she just really hates old people, and that made me kind of hate her.Kelli is also super grossed out by her husband. William keeps trying to kiss her, and grope her, and he talks about his plans to have sex with her later. She simply cannot understand how an unsexy old man (and former fat kid) could find an unsexy old woman attractive. She also cannot understand why she would have married him in the first place.You&#8217;ll be happy to know that, in the future, we&#8217;ll have cars that drive  &#8212; and parallel park &#8212; themselves, we&#8217;ll all wear electronic wrist pads that control our lives (and unlock our cars), our bathrooms will be full of buttons instead of plumbing fixtures, and we&#8217;ll have genetically modified yolkless eggs along with handy kitchen machines that boil them in five seconds. So many dramatic changes will be everyday conveniences in a mere twenty-five years!Future Kelli eventually learns that she&#8217;s made a decent career for herself, she has two grown children, lots of friends, and her sister doesn&#8217;t hate her anymore. Everyone loves Kelli. Eventually she comes to the mature realization that being old isn&#8217;t quite so terrible, and maybe her husband isn&#8217;t totally gross, even though she still doesn&#8217;t want to have sex with him.As a time-travel story, this was more whimsical/fantasy than grounded in any sort of reality. It boasted a future of all wonderful things, as if all global problems had been solved so that we could now focus on magic kitchens and bathrooms. As a romance story, it was a ninety percent failure because that&#8217;s approximately how much of the book Kelli was disgusted by her husband. Her epiphanies in the final act were nice, but she could have spent more time trying to understand herself and less time whining about how old she was and how much she hated the future. Which also makes me question how young, snotty Kelli could have earned such a nice, down-to-earth future if she hadn&#8217;t time traveled in the first place? I have to imagine an endless loop of time travel because without it, Kelli would have lived a vain, superficial existence until dying in some tragic accident in her thirties.So, I didn&#8217;t love this so much. Maybe if you don&#8217;t want to think too hard, you won&#8217;t hate it.Rating: C-This review originally posted on Red Hot Books at: http://redhotbooks.com/2014/07/review-fast-forward-by-juliet-madison.htmlReview copy provided by the publisher.",2

Letters missing, semantic errors, syntactical errors, etc.**SPOILERS**The characters were something else too.  There is not one thing I liked about the heroine, Elizabeth.  She is immature, selfish, self-serving, manipulative, etc.  First of all, the reasons she left the Hero (Gabriel) in the 1st place are just absurd.  It's about his father and if she would have told him, he would have taken care of his mother.  Secondly, withholding the pregnancy from the father when he has done nothing to deserve such cruelty-NO!  You just don't do that.  Third, she was so blas&eacute; about the threat to her life and that of her unborn child.  She was concerned about her life changing and the sacrifices she would have to make.  Fourth, she wants to give the baby up and go on with her life and peek in here and there?!  Are you kidding me?!  She wants Gabriel and the nanny to raise him while she pursues her dreams.  Newsflash-there are single mothers everywhere that get an education and a career  and have it 10x harder.  She has a man, financial support, family/caregiver support, a nanny, maids & cooks and she is unwilling...Elizabeth did not bond or have a nurturing bone in her body.  After giving birth, she was ready to bolt.  Her son wasn't even three months old and she felt she already fulfilled her duty.  The author really made her out to be unlikable.  And she did bolt.  Right after Gabriel suffers unspeakable loss and betrayal.  She left him and their son.  She also betrayed him by going to work with his rival and further enflaming a long standing fire.  This heroine is a PIECE. OF. WORK.Gabriel's mother...a bit unrealistic.  Too much.  You have her and Elizabeth that both don't have a maternal bone in their body and are not nurturing AT ALL.Gabriel...I get it.  He has been wronged and betrayed.  He has been robbed of soo much and he wants to protect those he loves.  He is overbearing at times.  He is not forthcoming at times.  BUT I GET IT.  Elizabeth panics and stresses over everything.  he did not want to add any more than that and he wanted to protect her.  He also knows how she is about relationships and feelings about being a mother and he wanted to change that.  I feel for the Hero.  Poor guy!The plot was just ok.Big cliffhanger, AGAIN.  Gabriel and Elizabeth are not together AGAIN.  But, the ending drama surrounds their son.  I'm sure Elizabeth will care less and Gabriel suffers yet again.  I have to say, I don't like to read about drama surrounding hurting/harming children.  I draw the line there.  I know this is fiction but that is just a &#34;no-no&#34; for me.For me, this series stops here.  The author went in the wrong direction with this one and made this a less than pleasant read.  There was not a good flow.  There was not balance.  I wasn't rooting for the characters because I adored them and/or related to them.

B008MVQWAG,A2EU9VP0MRMUGE,"09 15, 2012",Sarah (Feeling Fictional),Cosmo's Fifty-One Shades of Blonde,"Cosmo's Fifty-One Shades of Blonde is a very short story coming in at around 30 pages and spilt into five chapters, I believe part of the story was originally published in the magazine and has now been released as an ebook with additional added material. Obviously the title of the story gives away the fact that this is going to have similarities to the incredibly popular Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy and I couldn't resist giving it a try. I was hoping for a short but hot read with a sexy alpha male and to some extent that is what I got but unfortunately I found myself feeling disappointed. The story is short and hot but I didn't find myself attracted to Christopher and I couldn't understand what he and Megan saw in each other.I love a good smut scene and I have to admit that the sex in this story was quite well written but I like a bit of a plot to go along with my erotica. In this case the characters were completely one dimensional, they hardly say more than two words to each other before they're at it like rabbits, in fact from the little they do say it's quite obvious they neither trust or particularly like each other. The plot (if you can even call it that) of the young office assistant with dreams of being a journalist just happening upon her super rich boss as he has a secret meeting with a high profile mob member (in a public restaurant of all places - because that's where all famous people arrange their top secret meetings that could end their career if they are discovered!) was just beyond ridiculous.Cosmo's Fifty-One Shades of Blonde is obviously taking the mickey out of the series it is using to attract it's readers and unfortunately I'd have to say my advice would be to spend your money elsewhere. If you are looking for a quick read that has roughly 25 pages of sex in a 30 page story then this will probably hit the spot but if you want likeable characters and a story to go along with the smut then there are plenty of better options out there.I'm going to end this review by giving the story an award for worst first line I've ever come across in an erotic novel:""If you owned a vagina, you couldn't help but notice this man as he walked into the restaurant.""",2

Sean, Patrick, and Sandra were all best friends who were in the personal training business. It made sense and would have been an easy transition for their relationship to go from platonic to romantic considering they always did everything together. Sean and Patrick always debased Sandra's suitors, and they never did more than casual dating with the women they were with. The issue that irked me the most was in the beginning before Sandra accepted the relationship with both Sean and Patrick. All of the fantasizing that Sandra had of them, the reading of materials dreaming it was them, and then when the opportunity presented itself Sandra is indecisive, even after they told her they talked it out amongst themselves before they even approached her with the idea? Annoying. The threesome's relationship was solid. You could see the love they had between one another, but then there was doubts among one of the men about the menage, but it wasn't clear if it was a past or present issue. The story was lagging a little when it wasn't focusing on the trio. The story should have focused more on the relationship of the three. The sex scenes weren't bad considering it was a menage. The first two intimate scenes were titillating, but after that, the scenes faded into the next chapter. The book actually could have been shorter, and it may have made it better because it would have just been about the relationship or could have been longer and actually explored the good and the bad of the relationship when they became intimate.",2

Punctuation in general is important.I know it's generally frowned upon to mention editing issues in reviews, but when they're as prolific as they are in this book, they really detract from what would otherwise be a good story.And this is a decent story, if perhaps a little predictable. It was written like a movie, and I liked the idea of writing the narrative in present tense (although occasionally the author slipped into past tense there as well). The problem is that I think it made the very simple language stand out even more. There's a bit of a disconnect there, as the language used makes the book one that would be easily understood by a junior primary school kid, but the subject matter is in no way appropriate for children.It's not the worst story I've ever read, but I've read plenty better.

None of the characters display ANY tactical awareness - not the special forces operator nor any of the collection of soldiers he has with him, not the bad guys, and certainly not the main protagonist.As another reviewer points out, the characters keep engaging in stupid, contra-survival activities and for the most part get away with it:*The zombies are blocks away, and at the very last minute the main protagonist suddenly remembers her handgun, retrieves and opens the locked box it's stored in, verifies it's in there, and then RELOCKS the gun back in the box and sticks it under the front seat of her escape RV.*They make it to their survival compound, but don't maintain a watch on the CCTV monitors at night.*They DON'T check newcomers for bites or scratches; the newcomer's word is sufficient.*They regularly smoke dope and listen to music as they make their forays out into zombieland.*They keep all the weapons under lock and key 'to keep the children safe'.There are more, but these are my favorites.Bottom line:  It's a well-written, not-very-good zombie tale.",2

I tested it first with tissue and then with the Paperwhite, and am pleased to report that the case is truly waterproof.  This makes it a great candidate for tub, poolside, and beach reading.  (Note, however, I did not test for the thirty minute time the case claims.)The other really nice thing is that the case makes your Paperwhite feel almost invincible.  It adds bulk and weight, but in return, you get a sturdy protection that feels like it could handle a lot of damage.However, the issue that made me return both cases and give such a low rating:  I could not get a case where the screen protector was not damaged.Both the case I ordered and the replacement had scuffing and other imperfections on the screen layer that severely degraded my reading experience.  I could handle the blurriness that the screen protector added, which was primarily due to the screen protector being slightly raised from the screen and rather thick.  I could *not* handle the way my eyes would constantly shift to the damaged spots of the screen protector.  No matter what, the primary goal of using my Paperwhite is always to have a pleasant reading experience.  Even if the case is waterproof, $70 is too much to spend to stare at a scuffed screen layer.Another con is that the case is incredibly hard to open.  It needs to be to create the necessary seal.  But it's not something you'll want to deal with taking your Paperwhite in and out of.  If you think the case is hard to open empty, just be aware that it gets much worse when the Kindle is in it and you can't press the sides in to help you.  Make sure the case and Kindle are nice and clean, with no trapped dust, before you seal the case.In short, if you are lucky and get a unit where the screen protector is not damaged, you plan to leave your Paperwhite in this case, and you don't mind trading some bulk and a bit of clarity for the protection this case offers, you'll love it.  Otherwise, you might want to rethink it.",2

Here is my honest review.This is the first book I have read in the Under the Hood series yet it can be read without having read the first book. The series follows a group of women trained as mechanics that band together and open their own garage. I think this is such a great setting for a romance book. Mel was fairly likeable as the heroine. She is shy and hesitant about love - which is a bit of a stretch. I think if there had been a little more development to highlight her shyness and tomboy spirit it would have been more believable. Heath (what a name for a romance hero, right?) is such a laid-back, yet hard-working guy it was hard to believe he was from New York City. However he was super sweet yet completely a guyat the same time.One thing that Clements did that I appreciated was that both Mel and Heath were determined to reach out for the happily ever after - even though Mel beat him to it!",2

B00F007WI8,A3UHDN1OOU5BLU,"09 19, 2013",Writer Geek,Repulsive to say the least!!!,"Everyone has their own definition of what makes a story a great book. What I think of this story makes me feel like a minority amongst the sea of the reviewers gushing and the overwhelming 5 star reviews.I am a big fan of Ms. Alessandra Torre, so far all the books I've read of hers are exceedingly good. She has an incredible talent and a great imaginative mind that captures the readers in awe. Her writing style is bold, different but brilliant and I LOVE it! It is for this reason and the astounding rave reviews it has received that I was so excited and couldn't wait to read it, only to be stunned to find the content and the plot repulsive. I couldn't fathom what part of Nathan's character some reviewers find amazing, the old saying ""what one man's trash is another man's treasure"" easily come to mind. How can a pig of man like Nathan Dumont and a slut like Candy can be called romantic and amazing story is beyond me! This disgusting man only got to be like a normal person at the last remaining 18% of the book, the rest he was indecent and a complete jerk. Insisting to have sex in the open while his bodyguards are there watching made me cringed. The author's attempt to redeem Nathan's character in the last few pages doesn't hold merit, the bottom line is, Nathan treated Candy lower than dirt.Candace/Candy has been a stripper in a seedy men's club and although she has a bachelors degree, oddly she chose to be one and has been a stripper for three years, when she was singly picked by Nathan Dumont. A handsome sophisticated self made millionaire who's idea of having sexual satisfaction is to have Candy perform for him and suck him while his bodyguards watches. One night he pays the club's owner an extra amount of money so he can take her out of the club, orders her to give him a blow job in the back of the limo, then drugs her, takes her to his home, orders her to strip, then had sex with her again and insist they do the nasty in front of his bodyguards, they will have to be present each and every time, standing there watching. The next morning he makes an incredulous offer to Candace to marry him in papers only, in turn he'll foot the bill of her ailing father's hospital care and up keep. He doesn't give her money but a monitored  and controlled credit card to use. However, she's never allowed to sleep or even stay in the main house with him, she's prohibited to spend time there unless he's screwing her. She can only stay and live in the guest house which walls are made of glass, where everyone and anyone can see her doing anything and everything, including while having sex with Nathan Dumont. She is summoned to the main house by one of his guards whenever he's feeling horny ( which is frequent ) and again, sex her up while his guards are watching. Anytime and every time they have sex, his bodyguards or anyone around gets to watch, how SICK is that? The fact that this has received a staggering rave reviews is very disturbing! No self respecting decent man would have sex while his whole staff are in the same room watching.Candy has a college degree but ended up being a stripper, she says it pays her bills and keeps her off the street. So it doesn't make any real sense for her to be running behind the rent of a tiny room in an unsavory neighborhood every time it's due. She could barely make both ends meet, it defies the logic on her reason why she chose to be a stripper. Candy says she doesn't ever do the nasty with clubs clients, the most she's done is give them a lap dance or a hand job, yet she went with Nathan Dumont easily and willingly, have had sex with him in the open where his bodyguards watches. She had had sex with Drew, Nathan's right hand man more than once, then claims she's fallen in love with Nathan while obsessing and thinking about Drew, how perverse!Nathan's insistence on having them photographed when they attend functions as a happy loving couple is to flash out his over jealous ex fiancee out from hiding, who run out on him taking 50 million of his dollars. He'll do anything and use Candy in all ways he can to get his ex fiancee back, the only love of his life.So Nathan and Candy continues having sex in the presence of all the bodyguards around, he would kick her out of the main house and sends her back to the glass guest house when he's done with her. And he has the guts and audacity to tell her he's purposely degrading and humiliating her so she doesn't get any wrong ideas and form any attachment to him. I guess to others, as long as the story has an HEA, it didn't really matter how sleazy and low life the hero is. Such as Nathan Dumont who pandered his own wife services, to his business associate who asked to find him a whore for his own sexual pleasure, Nathan tells him no need to look for one since Candy is a great f***! he offered Candy's services.**spoiler** He ordered her to suck this man's penis in the back of the limo, while he and his bodyguards watched, including his right hand man Drew, whom Candy has been having sex with.**spoiler** My GOSH! how much more SICK can this plot gets? It's OBSCENE! I guess some reviewers who rated this story ""AWESOME"" and ""WONDERFUL"", didn't matter how low and degrading he's treated Candy, as long as in the last few pages the hero gets the heroine and they end up together, it didn't really matter how sleazy, no moral values and indecent the hero is.

B00GOMOPCC,AD9USVMNT92CE,"12 3, 2013",Deke,Good Story Ruined by Bad Physics and Poor Formating.,"I'm a little harsh on this book because of the price tag, $5.99, for that kind of money I expect better, even from an independent author.The Premise was solid, earth discovers they are not alone and are brought into a war, they really aren't prepared for. The political angles were interesting, though inappropriate for the setting, I mean the end of our race is at stake but people are still to stupid to rally and are led by mass media? Look at history, when faced with an outside force countries rally together, it's always happened and if it's a genocidal situation, racially, I'm sure the human race would rally instead of worrying about the latest version of the Kardashians, the motivations were accurate for our current crop of politicians. The author also did a great job of limiting the dues ex machina, something most authors, sadly, rely on to complete a novel.There were many petty issues, I mean come on the leader of the Terran government accusing people of not liking him because he was black? It's nearly 300 years in the future, we've got one world government, colonies, and advanced tech and were still playing the race card? Silly, just silly and one of many that I could write a wall of text about. My real issues with the book came with the total lack of research on physics and the utter disregard for consistency.At the beginning the humans &#34;seem&#34; to control a grand empire, everything is the largest in the galaxy, the author talks about things billions of light years away, the Milky Way is only 120,000 light years across, we have ftl communication, how? There is thought that the aliens came from another galaxy, etc., etc.,  Later we learn that in fact the human &#34;empire&#34; is only 4 planets, almost everything of political importance happens in Sol orbit and the people of the home planet have little vested interest in the concerns of the genocide happening on the colony worlds. As we learn that humans are actually quite new to expansion, were constantly being told that humans have something bigger and badder than the rest of the Galaxy, how? We don't have a clue. An analogy would be the 5'7&#34; small town athlete who thinks he's the best basketball player in the state, he truly has no clue. I understand where the author was going, and I think my analogy probably sums it up, it was just very poorly done with too grand a scope. It needed to be tightened way up! You could start by replacing &#34;Galaxy&#34; with &#34;known Terran Space.&#34; An example would be, &#34;The communication relay was the largest known in Terran space&#34; not &#34;The largest known in the Galaxy.&#34; After all we learn that the enemy have been in the stars hundreds, if not thousands of years longer, conquered, hundreds, then thousands, then &#34;unknown&#34; numbers of civilizations, of course we've never run into them, so the assumption is the Galaxy must be huge, big enough we've never been discovered by this behemoth.The bad physics. I know it's sci-fi and certain liberties are taken, but again for $5.99 I would expect a little research, here's some clues. 1: There is no gravity, thus mass is determined by thrust. 2: When that thrust is applied it will travel at that speed, in a straight line, unless something is applied, forever. 3: There is no artificial gravity control in the space fighters, as evidenced by the scenes in the book, thus they would never be able to make the minute changes needed for dogfighting, they could not stop themselves from hitting anything in their way and with speed relative to their enemies would never have a chance to &#34;get a lock&#34; on the enemy.Coming out of blue space hundreds of kilometers apart is not &#34;spread out&#34; it's freaking super danger close, especially with the physics as described above, it's the equivalent of being on a Tokyo train car at rush hour, and if you've seen the pictures of the guys who are pushing people on trains during this time you know what I'm talking about.There were issues with character development, formatting, dialogue and spelling, all those things I can tolerate, if the basic story is a good one, which this was, but again, for $5.99, I would def. have to recommend people not buy this book, if not for the price structure I would have given it at least 3 and would recommend the continued reading of the series, but if the price structure stays the same, it's a no buy on my list.",2

There are a constant number of new characters in each books which don't necessarily connect to the previous ones also.

The real &#34;hook&#34; of this book, though, is that the female detective investigating these crimes (murder and cyber-hacking) is herself being blackmailed by the voyeur for her own porn addiction and  self-pleasuring activities, all of which the voyeur has captured on-line.  Told from the view of this female detective, the story spends a lot of time discussing the moral dilemma she faces as she elects not to inform her co-workers(s) of her (blackmailing) secret due to embarrassment, and plain &#34;old self interest&#34;.  Her behavior in doing this, while not professional, is certainly understandable.  And for most of the book, I was able to &#34;buy into&#34; her actions - and to appreciate the creativity of a plot that dealt with the somewhat novel crime of web-cam spying and blackmailing,  But the book ultimately alienated me with its resolution of the crime.

For a police officer I was disappointed to read that she stood by during the big fight and did little to help.  Her loved ones were hurt and put in danger because of that. Also her arguments to stay alone sound less like protecting others and more like self-pity and martyrdom.There are more books in the series so I guess it might get better.

I understand that each Silo might develop with some distinct differences, but it didn't make any sense that people were frowned upon for not doing their part to bear children. They're not repopulating a planet...it's a silo, and the original books had more than enough people who dearly wanted children. If there was some underlying genetic reason they needed more people procreating, then tell us that (although I don't think I would have swallowed that, either.)The use of email and printing out copies of emails didn't fly.The storyline did take some leaps that I had a hard time following.

B008O0QUU2,A3FUOHN96YPZD1,"04 22, 2014","Gigimomma ""gigibookworm""",So close!,"This was my first book by this author and I'm very torn about the rating. On the one hand, I thought the romance was solid and the love scenes well written and sexy. The hero Chace was Alpha hot and Faye was sweet without being cloying. That being said, there were just so many other things that pulled me straight out of the story I cannot rate this more than 2 1/2 stars.Chace Keaton is the hottest detective in the small mountain town of Carnal, Colorado.One with a dark past and secrets that tear him up in inside.  Faye, the town's quiet, sweet librarian has been secretly crushing on Chace , who also admires her from afar, for years but circumstances and fate have kept them apart. They come together finally teaming up to solve the mystery of a young boy who has been stealing books from the library. Faye suspects the boy is being abused and enlists Chace' s help to get to the bottom of the situation. Pretty soon neither of them can keep their attraction under wraps and the sparks fly.Sounds like a good read and it could have been pretty close to perfect had it been shortened by about a hundred pages. If there ever was a book that need it a good editor it is this one. The level of description is insane. For example, one scene where Faye and Chace are eating pizza and the authoractually writes out every time one of them picks up a slice and chews it. Phones do not just get picked up. The hero picks up the phone, pushes the button and puts it to his ear and repeats the entire exercise upon hanging up. This got really tedious really fast. There were also lengthy , repetitious monologues coupled with exhaustive descriptions that took up pages upon pages. By the time the character got to the point I had already forgotten what had happened three or four pages back. Another example of too much detail every time Faye and Chace had sex she had to go clean up. He would tell her to . Do I really want this level of reality in my escapism? Do I have to read that Faye changed into clean panties? I should hope if she changes into something that it is clean. Do I want to read about it? Nope.The dialogue was also curiously worded at times. Sentence structure was super wacky and questions were always statements which meant that not only was I, the reader, confused but also the character had to repeat the statement to clarify it was a question in the first place. Confusing to say the least. There was also a lot of whispering going on. Everyone and I mean everyone whispered. I get that Faye was a librarian but what was everyone else's excuse? Every other line of dialogue was whispered. It was really annoying after a while. In the end, I found myself skimming too much to justify giving this book a higher rating. There was a really good story here it just got buried and I find I do not have the patience to dig through crazy, repetitive, super long paragraphs about useless info like the fact that the mayor's daughter had a traditional Quinceanera party. Things like this filled up this book and did absolutely nothing to move the plot forward. Too bad because it really had a lot of potential and I really would like to find a new favorite contemporary author. 2 1/2 stars.",2
B00EUSSY3S,A1K1S9636ANFKV,"06 29, 2014",Amazon Customer,Great series! (But then there's all the talking),"Potential spoilers.....Well, I got about half way through Retribution (fourth in the series) and became very perplexed. The first book of this series is downright emotional - I cried more than once. I found the story to be enticing and beautiful. As I read on, I became aggravated. Only a week has passed in these four novels. I feel like, as a reader, I need more than just a week's worth of time for plot time and character development.Don't get me wrong - this story is very well written! It is spotless and the author doesn't leave any real plot holes - but she swings it too far the other way. To ensure there are no plot holes, the author is constantly having the characters talk. I mean, seriously, that's all they do. Talk out loud about things we, as readers, can figure out. Dialogue is way too heavy. I felt like the author wanted to make sure that women out there weren't going to be mad about the &#34;man in charge&#34; type of thing, so she spent pages upon pages making Quin this sensitive, caring, and boring character.She holds out the sex in this series,  which is completely fine - but to be honest, if I'm reading a book for the hot sex scene, I want it in book number one (two at the latest).  If i'm reading it to actually enjoy the story (which I was), I don't need graphics. I feel like it is not well balanced and out of place. I read four books to get to five chapters of graphic sex? At this point, I want to skip the sex and get back to the real story at hand.Overall, it is a good story line and I was pleased with the first book.

Unfortunately, he's on one such case, working undercover as a bodyguard for a popular movie producer while he waits to get the proof that the wife hired him to find. Proof that her husband is sleeping with America's Sweetheart, actress Julie Fraser.He hadn't been working undercover long when he first meets the former child star under less than auspicious circumstances. He's ""guarding"" the producer at a red carpet event when Julie arrives, but she doesn't make it into the building before the shots ring out, sending the crowd into chaos and knocking the star off her feet. Racing to her side to pull her bleeding body out of the line of fire, he manages to help save her life and takes a bullet for his efforts.Julie has been an actress long enough to have no more illusions about the darker side of fame, but she never expected to be gunned down for it. Recovering in the same hospital as the man responsible for that very recovery gives her a chance to thank him personally. Not only is he her hero, but he's also the sort of decent, honest man she wants to get to know even better.When repeated attempts to end her life prove Julie wasn't just a victim of random violence, Troy finds himself on shaky ground. Telling her who he really is will do more than just piss her off and ruin any good feelings she may have towards him, it could very well put her in the crosshairs of a determined killer.~*~I've been a big fan of the Adrenaline Highs series since its inception, and the previous book, Dangerously Close, was my favorite to date. That's why it sucks so much to have to say that this one didn't appeal to me. I struggled with the narrative and the characters, as well as several elements of the plot, throughout most of the book.Adams has always brought vibrantly flawed or damaged, believable, three-dimensional characters to life on the pages, characters who are uniquely individual and original. I just wasn't getting any of those vibes from either Julie or Troy in this book. Julie was a little too sweet, nice, caring, and perfect for my taste (which isn't bad so much as it is uninteresting) and Troy was a lying douchebag.Um...yeah...there may be some personal bias bleeding over into that opinion, but I'm sorry, there were a dozen times he could have come clean with Julie before they slept together and the fact that he not only didn't tell her the truth, but perpetuated the lie throughout the story, made me very uncomfortable with him as the romantic hero and set up what felt like a cliched and predictable suspense climax late in the bookAnd that's beside the point that I thought the premise for his investigation was a stretch. He's been hired by producer Ari's unhappy wife to get proof he's sleeping with Julie so the wife can divorce Ari's lecherous ass. That's fine on the surface, but I kept wondering why the wife's focus was so specific. Her husband is a sleaze who apparently bounces so many wannabe starlets on the ""acting couch"" that if extramarital sex were an Olympic event he'd have had the gold. If Troy was even remotely competent as an investigator he should have been able to provide proof of infidelity in no time. Mandating that the proof be her husband's adultery with Julie never made sense to me.That was a pretty big stumbling block for my willing suspension of disbelief, and it caused problems for me as it related to the entire setup of the plot. There were also several plot threads, like what was going on between Julie's and Troy's assistants and the backstory of Troy's childhood, that weren't fleshed out enough to have any positive impact on the story. They just served to muddy the waters and bog down the pace of the suspense, and that pace was already pretty slow because of a narrative that was heavy on narration and light on dialogue.There were good points, too, though. I did love the repartee between Troy and Julie in the beginning of the book, and I didn't dislike Julie as a character. She was cute and harmless, she just wasn't all that complex. My only issue with her as the romantic heroine, really, is that when compared to the other female leads in the series, she wasn't nearly as compelling or memorable.Actually, that pretty much sums up my feelings about this book in general.I've enjoyed this series, and have been highly entertained by Adams' deft talent for creating pulse-pounding romantic suspense. This book may not have been for me, but even the most adrenaline-pounding thrill ride in the world has its moments of down time. I have no doubt that the next in the series will have my adrenaline racing just as fast and high as did the three previous books.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

From the get go, it seemed that the main character, Lucy was a bit confusing. That never changed throughout the book. It was difficult to sympathize with her for that very reason. Miles, the main male character was just as bad. We're lead from the beginning to have a certain idea about their personalities, yet they changed drastically the entire book and not in a very appealing light.If that were the only down side to this book, I could look past it. But my biggest annoyance was the relationship with her &#34;friends&#34;. Fawn (the model), Krista (the Charlotte), and Betty (the lesbian). Holy cow! How were these women friends. From the time they get together for the wedding it was all catty remarks, jealousy and just down right being MEAN to one another! It was really aggravating. I can see how some friends can act a little bit like that towards one another but honestly it seemed as these women couldn't stand one another. And when they had &#34;moments&#34; of friendship, it fell flat and didn't seem real. That really upset me and I couldn't get past that throughout the book. Maybe that's why I didn't really feel this book as something I could fully invest my interest in. Besides all that, there were just too many unfinished side stories.

B00F0WRVSW,A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,"07 10, 2014",morehumanthanhuman,Uneven,"A new adult romance novel, this book feels like an extended wish fulfillment exercise where our young female main is wronged, wronged, vindicated, and avenged.  Our male main is simply an instrument of said vindication, as the sole purpose of his existence seems to be to validate Biz and be generically adorable.As our book begins, Biz is getting ready to start her senior year in college.  She had a rough go of it the previous year, as Burton chooses to illustrate by having the book progress in dual time -- we're taken through the previous year with Biz in alternating chapters.  This doesn't really work, as the &#34;flashback&#34; chapters lack the immediacy of the rest of the story.  It feels like a rushed retelling and the most important parts of the previous year aren't even covered in these chapters, but as part of a conversation Biz has in present day.  I am really unsure why Burton chose this method of telling the story.Biz was a hard character for me to get into.  Having a damaged or &#34;broken&#34; female main is an inescapable part of this genre's conventions, but I find that more and more authors are creating characters who are so delicately constructed that normal parts of life send them into a tailspin.  The story of how Biz gets PTSD is part of the plot so I don't want to get into it too much.  I'll just say that it felt ridiculous.  I wouldn't know how to respond to an actual person who was this fragile.  There were also elements of Biz that just felt special-special, like she&#8217;s the ONLY one who can call a certain character by a name because she&#8217;s just so winsome, Davis KNEW he had to have her after seeing a picture of her and hearing about how she loved &#8220;Less Than Zero,&#8221; etc.The decision to have a certain character driven by malevolence rather than thoughtlessness or selfishness also felt over-the-top for me, another way of creating a martyr-like aura for Biz.  Nothing about the resolution of that situation felt authentic.  There was a Lifetime movie style atmosphere of pathos and melodrama hanging over this book that was hard to reconcile with Burton's skillful portrayal of young adult friendships.  I felt like I was reading two different books jammed together.As the ending fell into a series of &#8220;Take that, people who don&#8217;t like Biz&#8221; flourishes, the sense of unreality heightened for me.  There&#8217;s the melodramatic confrontation, the elaborately romantic lovemaking, the sudden explosion of wealth, it was like a series of boxes being checked off.I think the author has potential.  There were scenes in this book that were quite charming and the side characters are skillfully drawn.  I just wish she had a lighter hand with some of the elements of the story.",2

Over the top descriptions that were way too 'in-your-face' of what they want to do to each other, w/ little follow-through. People would not talk to each other like they did, even in a suspended reality kind of way. The character's came across as shallow, needy, and just a bit 'mental' in my view. All four of them!This wasn't really a true menage, in a sense. There was Kate/Tom & Mike/John. With what came across more like partner swapping than anything else. Kate & Tom invite the other two to play, permanently. That's what I got.The suspense was also overdone & convoluted and required an intro to characters you care little for who may be a set up for a future series - which I will not buy. The time spent on this could have been better spent developing the main characters instead.Very annoying read. I had to make myself finish it. I also agree with another reviewer, it was choppy.If you want to read an enjoyable foursome menage w/ suspense please read: Playing Four Keeps by Kris Norris - sooo much better!",2

Both Mary Smith, the unlikely heroine, and Alasdair, Lord Datchworth, need saving and are well developed enough for the reader to get involved in their plight. Sadly, the plot is very thin and the crises are too easily resolved.  Two things really turned me off of this book. First, Alasdair is addicted to opium, although the reason behind that is never quite clearly resolved. He experiences hideous withdrawal symptoms--for about 12 hours!! Then he's off again. Sometimes he takes more opium and staggers around a bit and then goes on. Finally, he withdraws completely with minimal pain and anguish. Now I know that romance novels are not supposed to be realistic, but this really stretches things. For those of us who've read Jo Beverly's story of Darius Debenham's anguished withdrawal in ""To Rescue a Rogue,"" ""Hero of My Heart"" is nothing short of frivolous nonsense.

Also, no one can have sex with five different men in a matter of a few hours, one of the men being 12 inches (snort), then have sex with a man who is 8 inches and he still thinks she is tight.  This was the content for all 450 pages.  The little bit of plot included was randomly placed in the middle of the sex scenes, so it felt very disjointed and difficult to follow.

B006AU7FU2,A39NQQ8DO9OI66,"02 19, 2012",Tumbleweed,Not What It Seems,"This was one of the strangest books that I have ever read, and the Kindle cover of the copy that I received (a young boy looking at a picture book) has absolutely no connection to the story. Although the title name suggests that the story might be erotic, the content is much more of a discussion of attaining sexual pleasure and gratification. Reading it feels very similar to sitting in a classroom and participating in a clinical discussion - one that doesn't always make a great deal of sense. It's a short novel that takes about an hour to read.We eventually learn that the narrator of the story is the sister of a woman who is attending a program developed by someone she refers to as Dr. Morgasm (she says this is not her real name), presumably to help her improve her troubled relationship with her spouse. The role she takes upon herself is to protect her sister and prevent her from becoming involved in what she suspects is a cult. We learn that Morgasm is a support group ""dedicated to super-sizing your sex menu"" and ""increasing control over [your] own pleasure."" It discusses the notion of ""pleasure-deficits"" and the need to manipulate one's partner to achieve greater satisfaction. Successful adherents to the program can expect to have increased sexual satisfaction, effortlessly lose weight, and achieve counter-addictive behaviors (whatever those are), amongst other benefits.The instructor of the program, Louisa, leaves us with insightful gems, such as ""beneath the superficial physical aspect of male desire is a deeper yearning to return to the emotional security of the mother-child relationship. If we truly comprehend that men are just boys in bigger bodies, we'll be in the right mental place to pursue our pleasure objectives."" The narrator goes on to tell us more of Louisa's pitch: ""Allowing men to take a leadership role in our own pleasure activities is a big mistake. They've done nothing to make themselves qualified for such a position. They haven't taken any courses. They have no certifications. They just barge in and take charge because they think they're entitled to."" The narrator then laments that ""everyone was lapping this stuff up and there was nothing I could've said or done at that point to slow her down any."" Later, the instructor tells the class that ""the one common concern shared by most everyone there was a fear of losing the ability to withhold sex as a tactic for shaping male behavior."" She assures them that this is not the case - in fact, successful practitioners of Morgasm will find that they will have even greater power over their mate, effectively turning their mates into ""pleasure slaves.""We never really do learn what Morgasm really is, or even what the author's point was in writing the story. I'm assuming that this is intended to be a satirical book about self-help programs, though I never did figure it out for sure. The narrator asserts her hostility towards the program throughout the book, which has the effect of detracting from the concepts that the instructor was attempting to convey. Rather than drawing the reader into the story, the narrator is very distracting, with her consistent negative judgments. Also distracting were the overly-used clich&eacute;s and grammatical errors - the author would do well to find an editor to insert many missing commas, as well as rewording multiple sentences that end in prepositions.I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for my review.",2

B0088GGSR2,A1J4BSROV54M8U,"04 5, 2014",JANA410,"Started out great, but then fell flat....","I am sorry to say that this series did not live up to the hype for me.  I went into it anticipating so much and was blown away by the prequel book, but after that the story quickly ran out of steam for me. Sadly I DNF the series.  Here is my breakdown of what I did read:Not Today, But Someday:  Since I purchased the series as a bundle and this prequel was the first book in the bundle, I read it first and LOVED it! The writing was flawless.  The story was told from alternating POV, and the character development was excellent. I felt like I got to know Emi and Nate so well in this story.  It took place somewhere in the mid-90's, which is when I was a teenager too, so I loved when they talked about music and pop-culture that was relevant at the time. I loved their friendship.  I loved the chemistry and tension between them. I loved all of the secondary characters as well. This book was a solid 5 stars for me and really set my expectations high for the rest of the series.Book 1: Right from the start, Book 1 fell short for me. The characters just did not have the dimension in this book that they had in Not Today, But Someday.  Almost all of the book was told from Nate's POV and he was written to be a love struck fool, almost bordering on being a stalker.  Throughout the entire book he is Emi's doormat, pining away for her page after page, while she literally treats him like she couldn't care less whether he is in her life or not. I lost track of how many times in the book she abruptly got angry at him for basically no reason and didn't talk to him for months at a time. Is that really how someone would treat their best friend of 13 years?  It was really hard for me to connect to their friendship in this book and see why he was so in love with her because she was nothing but a bitch to him. In the meantime, while he was waiting around for her, (still just pining away), he went through woman after woman and was basically a doormat for every one of them too.  While they used him for his money and pushed him around, he showered them with adoration, flowers, and expensive gifts.  The Nate I fell in love with in the prequel book was gone from this one and replaced by a wimp. I was so frustrated by both characters that I felt like I just rushed through the entire book waiting for them to change into the characters from NTBS.  When it finally happened, it was at the very end of the book, and then the book ends abruptly and on a cliffhanger. I will add that I went into this series blind, but I did read in another review that a major event takes place at the end of Book 1, and halfway through the book, I had a good idea what it was going to be, so the ending of this book was extremely anti-climatic for me.Book 2:  Book 2 picks up where book 1 left off and is written from Emi's POV.  I have to give it to the author that Emi was a lot more likable in this book than in book 1, and the beginning of this book was written with a ton of emotion.  It didn't bring on the tears for me like it did for other readers, mainly because I was so disappointed with the turn of events for our two characters, but it came close. There were several times I was very choked up.  Halfway through the book though, I felt like the story just completely lost its steam. Emi's inner dialogue became extremely repetitive, and it became very clear where the remainder of the story was going once Jack came into the picture, so I just found myself reading for the sake of reading. There was no suspense, there was no question of what was going to happen because it was clear as day, so it just seemed pointless to continue.  I gave up on Book 2 right in the middle and basically pieced together the remainder of the story from other reviews.Book 3: Did Not ReadI am giving the Emi Lost and Found series 2 stars because I really only enjoyed the prequel. For someone else, this may be a 5 star story, but for me it was not. I actually downloaded Not Today, But Someday by itself and plan to keep it in my library because it was so good, but I am sorry that I read the other books.  I wish I had only read NTBS and left Emi and Nate with their whole future waiting for them and the possibility of someday....",2

We find out that Grace is feeling pressured by Mark to have a baby though she rather they actually get married first.It took me a long time to formulate what I had a problem with in this novel. I think the main problem that I found was that not only did the plot just border on the ridiculous throughout, but when we get to the climax and ending it just turned into a downright unbelievable novel.For Ms. Downing to write the character of Mark and her relationships with her girlfriends the way she did and then have the ending she wrote was just flat out trying to tie a bow on things to make it a happy ending (where none is deserved).In the end I didn't care for the main protagonist (she complains a lot about her life though she has it pretty well) and with my attention waning, I started wishing that I had selected another novel to read.I think there were certain elements there to make it into a good book but certain things would have to be re-worked to make it believable to readers who would want to read more by this author one day.",2
B009DJ5EKK,A2A41ZRVMO8WG2,"11 27, 2012",Book lover,Disappointing!,"This is the second installment of the Highlander Trilogy and I seriously doubt if this installment could stand alone, more specifically one surely would have to read the first installment before reading this one. Taking into consideration the totally unacceptable ending of book one,  I tend to argue that these two books should definitely have been one, hence most probably ""pricing"" reasons made two out of what should have been one!Several reviewers commented on the editorial, grammatical and other mistakes in the book - I agree. There was nothing wrong with my money when I bought the book(s) why should there be anything wrong with the product?!Back to the story: There isn't any reason to summarize this installment since this is just the continuation of book one, hence the story line and characters remain the same. The positive thing was definitely that I was immediately plunged into the action of book two (well, it couldn't be else since book one was interrupted nearly in the middle of the sentence!). The suspense part of the book was surprisingly well conceived, though it didn't live up to its potential. Instead of ""confession-like revelations"", which were thrown at me in huge monologues, I would have preferred to participate as a ""silent and passive witness"" in the unfolding of the mystery. Anyway, this is a question of personal preferences and as such there was nothing wrong with the author's way of elaboration - it just didn't sit well with me.However, what was definitely ""curious"", to the extent of annoying me,  was the insatiable sexual attraction between Dawn and Cree. Just to put things into the right frame: I do appreciate hot, sizzling and sheet-fisting sex scenes - as long as they are well integrated into the plot. This was definitely not the case in this book.This isn't my first book of this author and usually Donna Fletcher delivers.

But the author sought reviews so I finished it. Very short story, so short review.There is the bare concept of a story here, and I commend Mr. Dickerson for having the courage to put it out into the world. One could argue that the length is too short for tension to ramp up sufficiently before the ""quick knife to the gut"" (the author's words, not mine), but that's the author's prerogative.  And the ending certainly confirmed my nasty, growing suspicion.However, it is not a good sign when the first technical error occurs four words into the story and the second one occurs in the very next paragraph. I'd like to think that most of the errors are more the edit/proof variety but repeated instances show that the problem is more fundamental.TEA TIME is too short to even judge Mr. Dickerson's merits as a storyteller.  But no story, however unique or clever, can withstand weak technical writing skills. Proper grammar and word usage, as well as punctuation and sentence structure, are among the most basic and important tools to an author.  And AFAIK, there are additional rules to fiction writing (e.g., for dialogue).  One could argue that it's possibly ""beginner's mistake"" but frankly, that doesn't hold much water.  Have new authors never read a properly written book prior to publishing their own work?Perhaps other readers can ignore and/or place less emphasis on such things but for me, they are distracting and severely diminish my reading experience/enjoyment.

B00HRGXNQS,A2PC5ZS9557591,"05 7, 2014",Allison M. Dickson,Sleep Donation Cured Me of Insomnia,"I was compelled to read this after Russell's appearance on Fresh Air, but I was incredibly disappointed to find that it took me far longer to finish this novella than it should have.The irony lies in the title. Sleep Donation, a rather conceptual story about a world being overrun with chronic insomnia and how sleep has become a donated commodity similar to blood, was managing to cure my insomnia every time I opened it by putting me to sleep after reading only a couple pages.I think this mostly has to do with Russell's incredibly heavy reliance on exposition to sell her idea, a trap that newbies to this genre typically fall into, where they feel they must explain EVERYTHING about a world without first delivering us a character we care about.There is almost no active storytelling going on here. Through the endless explanations of her main character, we learn about the sleep crisis, and the sleep-deprived ""orexins,"" who are dependent upon sleep transfusions to stay alive. We learn all the ways in which people are encouraged or coerced to donate hours of their sleep to help these people, and how the main character manipulates donors by using the harrowing plight of her sister who died from extreme insomnia. We learn about some of the strange cultural things that have arisen around a world that suddenly finds itself less and less able to sleep. We learn about ""Baby A,"" a universal sleep donor, whose sleep is so pure that it's become the most precious weapon they have in their arsenal. We learn about ""Donor Y,"" who introduced a rogue nightmare into the world's sleep supply, and how it's making people not want to sleep at all. Of course, we learn about the nightmare, but it's never described to us so that we could truly understand WHY these people would rather suffer without sleep than deal with a nightmare. We learn about Night Worlds, these curious places of nighttime debauchery created by people who either willingly refuse to sleep or can't sleep.We learn about all these things and more, but we don't SEE them. They are simply told to us in a way that is only compelling on the surface, but not believable in any way because it's all tied to a main character who isn't sympathetic or relatable in any way. At some point, an attempt at humanity is made by giving her a brief sex scene, but that's about as closed to fleshed out as we ever really get with her. And when a ""twist"" happens about 2/3 into the story, it's not really a twist at all. It's some contrived plot complication that shouldn't really even be a complication. In fact, I couldn't find a single reason at all to side with the protagonist on all her hand-wringing and moral vexing. If selling Baby A's pure sleep to a lab who could synthesize a cure is SO wrong, then I guess I don't want to be right. In fact, it doesn't even match up to the character's earlier proclamations to Baby A's parents that they hope to be able to synthesize clean sleep for people. That the whole moral foundation of the story rests on this particular premise makes the whole story pretty much a throwaway waste of time. I really wanted to quit reading after that revelation, but I was already so close to the end. And as far as the ending goes, it would be far too generous to call it that. It was more like the whole thing ran out of gas.If a writer is going to be so weird and conceptual with a story idea, they should commit to it in a way that allows the reader to become part of that world. Don't explain every single little thing. Let us discover them along with the character. Envelope the reader so deeply in what's happening that they're too fascinated to put the book down. Instead, Russell decides to treat us to overly precious language choices and absurd ideas for which no one even cares to suspend disbelief.Russell doesn't strike me as a natural science fiction author. She certainly has the creativity to think up fantastical ideas, but if she wants to branch out into more speculative genres, I'd suggest that she work harder to bring the reader into the worlds she's created rather than have us sit perched above them, struggling to stay awake.",2

While it wasn't full of errors they weren't completely absent.  This sentence is a perfect example: &#34;It has always rankled me that what is best for the gentleman is not always best for the lady yet society seems bent on keeping it these inconvenient methods.&#34;  Missing comma and what does &#34;bent on keeping it these inconvenient methods.&#34; mean?  Obviously,  Portman is trying to convey something along the lines of 'what's good for the goose should be good for the gander', but those last seven words make absolutely no sense (especially 'inconvenient' as it has nothing to do with the gender differences in those days in this context).The opening lines state &#34;I am with child, again.  In the unfortunate event I do not recover from this birth, I write my confessions in this diary.&#34;  Reading those lines I assumed that Cecelia had experienced previous difficult pregnancies, been warned not to become pregnant again or was in such an abusive relationship that she feared for her life.  But, other than some bad morning sickness with each pregnancy (the possibly deadly pregnancy she's talking about will be her fifth successful birth of five pregnancies - she hasn't lost any children through miscarriage), she suffered no more than any other pregnant woman of the day would have been expected to.  Other than this opening paragraph her fears for her life aren't mentioned again - if she had actually had reasons to fear for her life that might have made the book more interesting.Cecelia says she's writing this 'diary/confessional' to distract herself from her growing (unfounded) fear and because she wants to explain to 'those she loves' the reasons for the rumours surrounding her marriage to William.  If she's writing to her family members why does she feel the need to 'state that her husband was known to be something of a rake'?  Wouldn't they already know all about his reputation?  To be continued after dinner...After dinner - Now to the erotica genre this has been placed into.  What the hell?  How can anyone call the sex scenes in this book erotic?  The sex is peppered with sentences like this catastrophe: &#34;Without warning his hand came around and gripped my buttock, he squeezed it hard and the pain flashed through my entire body.  I gasped out aloud.  Despite the grinding weight and heaviness in my womb, a sure indicator of my body's interest in him, I was growing increasingly fearful.'To the bed with you, good woman,' William cried with gregarious chivalry.&#34;I know this because Cecelia herself states earlier that her marriage was arranged very shortly after the start of her first season.  How is &#34;To bed with you, good woman,&#34; chivalrous?  I would be more inclined to say it's imperious and domineering.I think I could safely diagnose Portman with acyrologia (from afar, even), specifically cacozelia - a kind of acyrologia in which one uses newfangled speech or Latinate diction in order to appear learned.  I think learning of this condition is going to be unbelievably useful in writing reviews of this kind - you know, where the book is bad.  I would not recommend this to anyone looking for good erotica, or even erotica at all as not one line of this is erotic.",2

B0055CODPG,A2PB0Z4YHC2LJ0,"09 22, 2013","mammasteed ""mammasteed""",Good and Bad,"After reading this book, I'm still not sure whether I liked it or hated it overall.  I liked some parts and hated other parts.  It was better than the first book in some ways, but worse in different ways.The story was certainly entertaining, and kept me turning pages.  I really did want to know what happened next.  So, in that sense, the book is a success in its own right, and a worthy successor to book one.However,  this book is sold as a middle grade book, but I find it entirely inappropriate for the average middle grade kid.  It might be okay for those on the older end of the spectrum, depending on the individual's personality and such.  I would definitely not want MY kid reading this.(That is particularly sad, because the first book was well-suited for the middle grade reader.)The book begins well enough, with Flea and his foster mother now living in a new town.  If you read the first book, you know that much was expected.  To my pleasant surprise, Flea has finally found a bully-free zone.  His life is pretty good; he's even making friends.  Of course he misses the North Pole, but he's finally found a good school in the normal human world.  Not bad.Then, the book angered me for the first time.  For no apparent reason whatsoever, we sit in on one of Flea's science classes, where the teacher lectures the class about how we now know that global warming is false.  She claims this is ""proven"" and her reasoning seems to be that there is a freak snowstorm.  Aside from the terrible science of claiming that one freak snowstorm somehow ""proves"" anything at all, the thing that bothered me was that a SCIENCE TEACHER was spouting this nonsense to a class of children.  At first, though, I thought that this was obviously some major plot point - a stupid plot point, but clearly important.  I was wrong.  It isn't.  It is just some throwaway garbage.  We never revisit this concept again.  Nor do we ever go back to the teacher and somehow weave this into her as a person (which would make it a character point).  Now, you might suggest that putting this scene in helps play up the oddness of the weather and how people are struggling to understand it, but I don't think so.  It struck me as nothing more than a pitiful attempt at political brainwashing.  In fact, the scene was entirely gratuitous.(If any readers are reaching for a dictionary, gratuitous means unnecessary.)While I am on the subject of things that annoyed me, I have to mention that the grammar is terrible.  The author claims that this is a revised version where the grammar has been cleaned up.  If that is true, then I wince to imagine what the original must have looked like.  The most persistent and annoying grammar issue was the author's apparent hatred of ""a"" and ""an"" throughout the text.  He either drops the indefinite article completely, or replaces it with the definite article (""the"").  This is especially annoying in wrongly-worded phrases like ""all of the sudden"" and ""in the matter of minutes"" (both phrases he overuses to the point where you could make a drinking game out of finding them).Also, another issue was stupid inconsistencies.  Is Scruffy a male or a female?  If you go by the pronouns, Scruffy must like getting gender changes often.  We also have name inconsistencies, where someone is doing something and then some other name will continue the action.  As a result, you are wondering whether the characters are randomly name swapping or whether you missed some crucial bit where two characters actually switched places or something.So, anyway, we get to the North Pole, and the book annoys me again.  Don't worry, I won't spoil any major plot points here.  So, Scruffy invites Flea to come visit the stable anytime.  Then, just a few short pages later, Flea is bored and has nothing to do because all his elf friends are hibernating.  So, you'd think he would pop in and visit Scruffy, right?  Nope.  He chooses to remain bored instead.  He also doesn't explore the rest of the North Pole village.  He has a reason for avoiding the Ice Bank (fear of what could happen to him if he gets too close), and of course he hasn't earned entrance to the Toy Factory yet, but the rest of the North Pole is wide open and much of it unexplored.  This is why Flea sits around with nothing to do for days.  But then, later, when things get busy (he's back in school and his elf friends are awake), THEN Flea decides to find some time to visit Scruffy.  Go figure.And, of course, we also invoke the maxim that Flea's questions must remain unanswered.  We're used to Niko refusing to answer Flea's questions; we all know he never has time for anything but expounding on how he doesn't have time for anything.  But, when Flea confronts Santa with a direct question, you'd think a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" would be in Santa's capabilities.  (A ""maybe"" or ""I don't know"" might have sufficed, if that were actually the answer.)Fair warning: the ending is grisly.  Many readers will be very upset by it, especially the younger ones.I also believe that many younger ones will be very upset about how the author handles Rudolph.  In fact, I'm older, and I was, well, let's just say not pleased.Some of the smarter younger ones will pick up on the fact that Santa is a liar, too.  I don't think you can do anything worse to the Christmas legends than turn Santa into a bald-faced liar.  It's subtle and most kids probably won't realize it, but there will be those that do.  I imagine most young kids won't appreciate it.On the plus side, this book does a better job of explaining the motivations of the secondary characters than the first book did.  I spent less time shaking my head and wondering why someone would do this or that thing.  This area could still use some improvement, but it is leaps and bounds better than the first book.This author's ability to keep me hooked and turning pages despite not really liking many of the places we were going on the journey is truly remarkable.  I have to give him kudos for his storytelling talent.  I can find no fault with his execution.The problems all lie within the content itself.There is currently a fad for twisting classic and traditional tales and icons.  This book caters nicely to that crowd.  Unfortunately, that fad is primarily an adult phenomenon, and this is marketed as a middle grade book.  As I said at the beginning, I think this book is not appropriate for a middle grade audience.",2

I started off liking the characters and the plot seemed interesting, but I really did not like the switching from fun, lighthearted romance to the dark, twisted boyfriend drama. I know it was supposed to show contrast between the two relationships, but it was just jarring and really disrupted the mood of the book. There were scenes in which the characters were laughing their pants off at practical jokes that were barely amusing. I just couldn't relate. Then the scene would switch to the dark, evil and crazy ex-boyfriend, which totally detracted anything funny that was happening with Kendall and Denn. By the end, I found the lead characters immature and annoying. I finised it but I was glad it was over.",2

Then she spends her whole time there waffling between Mike/Matt, and who he is and how she feels about him and oh my, what to call him... over and over and over and OMG I was so dizzy! About 75% of this book is Lydia going in circles in her mind. I was beginning to think she had OCD. Mike/Matt asks Jeremy to go to Iceland and keep an eye on Lydia. He does that, and they hang out together. And AGAIN nothing happens until we're at 90% of the book. One stinking love scene in the whole story!

B00HOSAE52,A34NMBSXU1AZ7T,"02 8, 2014",RLB,Undefeated,"Some mild spoilers may be included. Sorry.The good:I loved the little note exchanging scenes. It was very cute.I LOVED Shane's inner thoughts to himself as he's fighting.Ripp is pretty darn entertaining.The bad:At one point Kace is all sorts of beat up. To the point where Ripp and Shane are trying to call an ambulance. She doesn't let them. So what happened next? NOTHING. They went about and had a normal summer afternoon BBQ? Really? Kace described herself as looking like a survivor of a horror flick or something like that- yet no one bothers to help clean her up? She doesn't bother getting cleaned up herself? It made no sense. &#34;Yeah- I got beaten to bloody pulp, lets have some BBQ!&#34;The fight scenes- OK the detailed blow by blow the first time was great. But when each and every fight scene from Shane's POV is quite simply a chapter's worth of play-by-play with a little bit of fun inner thoughts it gets boring fast. If this is to be categorized as a &#34;romance&#34; type book, then please think of what the target audience is. Most of us won't give a damn what kind of punches are being made or in what order. Less of those details and more actual story would have been awesome.Speaking of the story: I'm sorry Author Scott but I cannot, for the life of me, pinpoint exactly what the point of this book is. At first we are entirely focused on Kace and her issues. Ok. Great. So this is a book about an abused woman who's finally getting away and coming into her own. Only WAIT- she gets away and apparently doesn't need ANY healing time whatsoever nor does she have any emotional scars that we see. Hmmm... OK. Now we're what? About &#8532; of the way through. What now? OH- now Shane is going to all of the sudden have to face his demons that haven't been mentioned AT ALL really, during the entire book. Only that he hides in his hoodie. So then what? Oh right, Shane magically recovers from his demons too. So now what? Do these two have to figure out &#34;how do we deal with these issues as a couple?&#34; Nope. So again- what is the point? It's not about the struggles of an abused woman, it's not about a man overcoming his past. We skim over where the REAL heart of those issues would be with that magically healing bandaid.And then it just.... ends. And my brain is a jumbled mess because there just HAS to be a point. Sigh.Enough of that. There are significant editing/proof reading mistakes throughout. They seemed to get worse as the book progresses, which signifies that the editor and/or proofreader was perhaps a bit too close to this project and therefore missing things. Or maybe they didn't bother doing multiple read throughs before hand. I don't know. Just an observation.Overall: I think this concept of abused woman meets champion boxer COULD have been a really amazing story.

Now Bryant has gone from a ruthless, uncaring thief to putty in her hands. This wouldn't be so bad if they weren't both after the same thing...or the fact that being with him puts her in terrible danger. Knowing he couldn't bear to lose his most precious and desired treasure, Bryant must find a way to get her out of this alive or lose her forever.Minuette Sinclair is far from being an eloquent lady. A tomboy at heart and a klutz would fit her better. To make matter's worse she eaves dropped on the wrong conversation and now she is racing to find the treasure before Bryant can get his hands on it. This should be easy, though, considering he seems to only want his hands on her and to make things more complicated she feels the exact same. Not a good mix when you are rushing to find hidden treasure.It seems Minuette's reaction to Bryant is completely mutual. Both having an overwhelming desire for each other creates a bit of a problem considering Bryant's employer is a crazed criminal who is in a big hurry to get his jewels and they seem to spending more time exploring each other than searching for it.This book was an extremely slow start. The repetitive reminder of Minuette's life decisions seemed to take up the first seventy pages of the book and is the biggest reason for the rating. To the author's credit and future readers the book picks up in pace a good bit after the first seventy pages and the plot was quite enjoyable.

There didn't seem to be any good explanations given for things (the house for one) being as they were being (trying not to spoil here) and what you think the book will be about is not, in any way, what the book ends up being about.I found I really disliked that - like a nagging in your mind the whole time you're reading and something you expect to find the answer to...and then it just glosses over the deus ex machina for the WHOLE story with a well, another time, it must not be that bad anyway paragraph.But it takes forever for you to find that out too; as well as the title being pretty irrelevant to more than a page of the book.

As I was reading I had the recurring thought of attempting to navigate through the fog. Throughout the story I felt like I had an idea of what the story was but for the most part everything was murky and unclear to me. It resulted in a book that wasn&#8217;t entertaining and one in which I ended up just trying to get to the finish line.One of the big issues I had with this book was the writing. Aside from the lack of depth and insight I had a problem with the way the story is structured including grammar and punctuation. I usually don&#8217;t have a problem with this as long as I can understand what the author is trying to convey. However, in this book it affected the way I read it and inevitably my enjoyment of the story. If you set out to explain aspects of the story, it behooves you to not have all the information and narrative run together. It makes it not only a daunting read, but the narrative comes off very clinical in its explanation. There is a way to include these explanations without taking away from the flow of the story plus it keeps the reader entertained while being informed. Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t present in this book. There were multiple times where the next page or two was filled with ongoing narrative without a break and I essentially powered my way through those parts.This issue affected the other aspects of the book. This lack of depth in the writing led to my lack of understanding of the characters and their relationships to each other. Yes, I know who Aefre was and that Constantine was her sire and that she eventually turned Devon. But I never really got a true sense of their characters. I didn&#8217;t feel anything for them and on the contrary I was left feeling questioning about their behaviors and relations. I never understood exactly the nature of her relationship with Constantine. The book never really goes in depth about their time together which would&#8217;ve helped in understanding why Aefre is who she is. The book goes on about the special connection a sire has with his/her charge but it never really differentiates it with actual love. It came off as just a reason to have Aefre be free to sleep with Devon and Cole. Speaking of Cole, I didn&#8217;t really know anything about him. None of his personality was really illustrated so for me he came off as being dull and almost childlike in his reaction to Aefre being a vampire. So with that being said, I do not understand how they can proclaim to love each other after a date. No real time was taken to establish that supposed connection between them. Their relationship was never believable to me especially when she sleeps with Devon after just having sex with Cole whom she proclaims to love.Now I know vampires, werewolves, witches, etc. are powerful in their rights but it stands to reason they would have their own set of weakness. It adds to their uniqueness and interest in how the characters adapt to them. But in this book, Aefre seems to be invincible with so much knowledge. She can speak so many languages (2 of which the book points out are dead languages), has the ability to shift (which she&#8217;s the only vampire capable doing so) plus she wears a ring that enables her to go out into the sunlight (Devon has one too). This makes her a pretty boring vampire. I want those kinds of complications in my paranormal/supernatural creatures. It helps shape who they are.I want to at least say that if nothing else, the sex in this book is good but I can&#8217;t even say that. Those scenes are reflective of the writing. There was no build up, no tension developed between the characters. It was quick without any passion and left you feeling lacking.I usually try to find positive things to say about a book, even if it&#8217;s in regard to having potential to be better. I cannot find that in this book. As the first book in a series, it was important that the story and characters were well laid out with a strong foundation to build upon as the series continues. Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t have it and ended with me being unclear about everything. There wasn&#8217;t any aspect of the book that I can put a positive spin and that saddens me. It is safe to say that I will not be continuing this series.",2

For someone who has never traveled at all, it would be worth reading this as a beginning guide.  If someone has traveled already, then they already know what this pamphlet offers (as it is only 22 pages).The book would greatly benefit from examples or more detail. For example, the author mentions perhaps utilizing the train while traveling, but offers very little advice or guidance. Riding a train in Switzerland (or Europe) is quite different from riding a train in India. Also, there can be lots of enjoyment of the local culture in taking the train, but there is so much guidance which could have been included; i.e., buying tickets, reading train schedules, etc.  Also, the author advises &#8220;safe-keeping&#8221; of one&#8217;s things, but never offers any ideas for how to do so - pretty much, just be careful.Links would also be helpful.

I love historicals, and I love this era (early 20th century, pre WWII).  I've read some of Ms. Cochet's stories before, and found them entertaining and lighthearted.  I guess my expectations were too high.Chauncey (later nicknamed Chance) is introduced as a homeless orphan in NYC who is lucky enough to be befriended and taken in by a theater group when he is 8.  He grows up in a loving, accepting, though somewhat haphazard, environment, where his homosexuality is accepted.  He's still a street tough most of the time, but is happy with life and his circumstances.&#60;spoiler&#62;Then the theater burns down, with his lover and all his friends in it.  Chauncey proceeds to become a self-destructive punk.  Despite being a &#8220;seasoned drinker and dope fiend&#8221; at age 16, he is picked up by a new theater (with Hollywood aspirations?  It was never clear), and until he is 25 he parties, sleeps around, apparently makes a lot of money which he doesn't spend, doesn't fulfill the terms of his contract but they keep him around anyway, and then he ends up in the French Foreign Legion.  The entire back story establishing his history is disjointed, confusing, and ultimately unconvincing.  I get that he is physically beautiful and emotionally empty, but how does that lead him to have money and end up in the desert?And the storyline never really gets any better.  In the French Foreign Legion, he apparently remains a punk and a troublemaker, and still acts like he is 15 years old, though I guess he is by this time pushing 30.  He is sent to Jacky, a commandant who surrounds himself with troubled queer men and saves them from themselves.  Chauncey becomes Chance, and it is insta-love for both of them.  Ugh, I really don't like insta-love.  The rest of the time in the desert (maybe about 50% of the book) is taken up with Chance growing up, and becoming a model soldier instead of an immature jerk, so he can deserve Jacky's love.  When Jacky is seriously injured, he is forced to leave the Legion, and it is revealed that he is wealthy, and wants to use his English manor home as a shelter for gay men.  So he arranges for his crew of queer misfits to all be discharged at the same time, along with the doctor who treated him who also happens to be gay, and they all go to England and live happily ever after.  Except for occasionally getting shot (Chance), and the secondary characters never accepting their destined true loves.  Really???? &#60;/spoiler&#62;So, we have confusing storyline, minimal or unsatisfactory explanation of character decisions, and completely unrealistic resolution of all problems.  The dialogue was mostly good, although the author's use of slang and words contemporary to the times was inconsistent, and sometimes also confusing &#8211; I ran across several terms that were very obscure to me as a 2013 reader, and there wasn't enough context to figure them out.  And though the blurb for the book included a disclaimer saying &#8220;these stories celebrate M/M love in a manner that may address, minimize, or ignore historical stigma&#8221; I still found the handling of societal reactions inconsistent.  One minute Jacky and Chance are sharing a tent and the rest of the camp knows it, and the next minute Chance is sneaking into &#8220;the back of the tent&#8221; (does that mean under the tent flap?) where they proceed to have fairly loud sex, with the lanterns lit, and no one knows.  This reminds me of a scene out of one of the Austin Powers movies that involves a tent, and  suggestive silhouettes, and I couldn't keep that out of my mind while reading this book!Overall, disappointing.  I don't plan on reading any of the rest of this series.",2

I found the system of magic to be interesting, and would like to see it fleshed out further.  However, I felt the book was deeply flawed.  First, there was no real sense of place. The book referred to one character as a Federal Agent constantly, but the main character would go down to the store for a biscuit (implying cookies) and constantly drank tea.  The overuse of the word &#34;whilst&#34; was obnoxious.  I understand that it's acceptable in UK English, but it was very jarring in a book supposably set in the US.  Or at least, I guess set in the US.  I don't think they have Federal Agents in the UK, though.  Another problem was the male lead.  He was the typical paranormal romance lead: rude, disbelieving, bossy, alpha male.  That would have been ok, I suppose, if the female lead hadn't been incredibly whiny.  I don't think that she grew a spine until the last 10 pages.  Another reviewer pointed out that the book ended abruptly.  This is a very accurate statement.

B00HOII46S,A29K38ABS8E9FD,"02 15, 2014",Becky,An Interesting Romance,"This would have made an interesting contemporary romance. But it was a very sad regency/historical. The writing was somewhat trite at times, but was for the most part not bad. The plot was completely unbelievable. There were no indicators of actual time period, although references were made to Florence Nightingale and the war in Crimea. However, in no time period would it have been acceptable for the heroine of the piece to do what she did. She could not at the same time live in her brother' s abandoned townhouse alone - a bachelor residence - and still be invited to Ton parties which she also attended alone. She could not have traveled from her country residence alone to visit her brother in Town either. She certainly could not have gone about her investigations by herself, much less conduct herself in a ballroom as she had, and still expect to be invited to them. I enjoyed the interaction of the characters and how their romance progressed. I thought the title rather insipid, since it really has nothing to do with the story, and after awhile I ignored all the historical absurdities. The book has promise, the writer has talent, but the story she wanted to write does not fit in the time period she tried to place it in.",2

B00EAZXVFM,A3G63FLZP880X2,"03 16, 2014",NatashaMay,I give it 2 and a half stars,I received this book in exchange for an honest review (LoP)We&#8217;re told in the blurb that Mila is a descendant of a powerful werewolf bloodline so there are no surprises when her eyes change in the story. And since she&#8217;s so powerful we already know she&#8217;ll come out as the winner at the end. So what&#8217;s left is the story in between. But sadly there was nothing of substance there.There was an attempt of romance but I felt like the attraction was forced. It just didn&#8217;t feel natural to me. The dialogue between Mila and Landon was a little off to me. I couldn&#8217;t imagine two people conversing this way when they meet under the circumstances that they&#8217;ve met. For two people that are supposedly quite reserved and private they sure told their stories to each other quickly. For some reason I was bothered how they talked to each other. It was like the reader needed to get all the details from the backstory as soon as possible and this was the way to do it. Mila was portrayed as a tough cookie but Landon spoke very condescending to her like she couldn&#8217;t survive without him.This story dragged and nothing really happened for the first 3/4 of the book. There was so much preparation for this fight that it was annoying. Why do we need to know what they&#8217;re building every second of the day? And when it finally happened it was all so convenient. We get to read about all this history and who the villain is supposed to be but when it all comes down to it we&#8217;re up against a stranger that had nothing to do with Mila&#8217;s history.I&#8217;m sad to say this was not a book for me.,2

While searching her apartment, he learns she participated in a dinner club for singles.  He decides to conduct his own investigation into her disappearance.  While at one of the dinner soirees he meets Megan, one of the more reluctant participants.  She has been dragged there by her femme fatale friend Brenda.  Brenda also goes missing leading Greg and Megan to join forces to locate and unmask the serial killer.Although the plot sounds promising, the execution is awful.  With the exception of Greg, all the charactes are one dimensional and immensely unlikeable.  I can certainly understand why none of them have dates.  The writing is clumsy, the red herrings painfully obvious and quite frankly, by chapter two, I just didn't care.  Greg and Megan's investigation consists of swilling wine and tramping through the outback, alienating the police and breaking laws, all done without wit or suspense.The author does no favors to those suffering from mental illness, making a character with bipolar disorder seem like a real freak.

She has decided to never allow a bonding with a shifter mate. Even if he IS her mate. The reasoning behind this is that she has seen her mother languish, yearning for death, after the death of her bonded mate, Jaylin's father. Perception is key here. Jaylin perceives her mother's suffering and her wishes to die so that she can be with her husband for an eternity. Her dad  has been gone for 20 years. And she feels that's a LONG LONG LONG time for her mother to miss someone so intensely.So...she decides she will never bond with a shifter because then if HE dies, she'll be sad until she dies. If SHE dies, then he'll be sad until he dies and joins her in shifter heaven.To thwart that, she plans to marry a human...because then when either of them dies it won't hurt so bad. What? Because humans don't care that much? I found this reasoning to be faulty. Which leads me to believe that this author didn't write this book for me. There are many highly rated reviews for this book which proves that she did write it for a wide group of people.

Even taking into account that she was 100 years older, in the first three books, it just doesn't feel like it makes sense anymore.

Although some other reviewers mention that there's sexuality in the book, I was startled by the discrepancy between what reviewers describe and what was actually there.  Yes, a teenager is given an amulet that offers invisibility; what no one else has mentioned is that EVERY SINGLE TIME he puts it on he becomes a voyeur to some sort of sexual activity, most of which he actively seeks out.  (I'm sure some late-teenage boys would be interested by this notion, and would use such an amulet in exactly this way, but I still found it creepy.)  There's masturbation, lesbian experimentation, oral, anal, toys . . .  All of this superimposed on a rather overfamiliar story of a young man finding he's always loved the girl next door.  I found the collision of these two styles - extended ""Penthouse"" letter meets male Gidget - to be jarring.  And I kept waiting for even one other (more creative) use for such a gift to suggest itself to the hero, who's supposed to be of above-average intelligence, and to have some spiritual depth.

She steps in to take care of it when Philip (the French man) expresses interest in having her work for him. Then he disappears and returns a few years later to collect her.The problem with this book is that it's labelled as a romance. There is no romance here. She pines for a man she leaves behind, and that's pretty much the extent of the romance in this story.The villain Philip is one dimensional at best. For a man she works for, we don't get a better understanding of his character. He's just aloof and wicked, and that's pretty much it.And the sex? For a good while there, it's lesbian sex (and I'm not fussed at all about woman on woman scenes, so don't call me a prude) but it wasn't hot at all. It felt awkward and coerced.I felt detached to every single character in this story. It was like reading about someone from very, very far away. You watch them move around, hear them speak, but you don't FEEL for them. And that's the main problem in this book. I didn't feel for Amara's struggles. I couldn't relate to her issues because they could have been easily avoided if she'd just communicated a little more instead of facing all that heartache.When we finally get answers, they're vague and weak at best. The plot holes are everywhere. It's a bit of a headache too when so much is already going on. Very unsatisfying.*******SPOILERS AHEAD****** DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK*********The scene she's giving that old man a handjob while staring at another woman doing the same? I'm not sure if the author was going for shock value, but the thoughts that went through Amara made me dislike her so much. Just so unrealistic.The Nolan thing? COME ON, who didn't see that coming? ESPECIALLY when she bumps into that certain someone in a place she only told Nolan she'd go to. SIGHHHHH.And stringing Colin along the way she did. Why not just tell him she's forced into a proposition that threatens the future of her parents and make him understand that she's taken off for two years to repay some debts? Instead, the idiot just rambles on with, &#34;I just can't be with you, but I love you. But I can't be with you. I just can't.&#34; Fat tears, sobs, heart ache, etc etc. And all that did was make Colin feel like she chose a job over him, hence why he hates her so much. And rightfully so. If I knew Amara, I'd kick her in the vagina and walk away forever. He didn't deserve that treatment.The end.",2
B00BETA0MO,A284NLIUNCMI3N,"09 11, 2013",Amazon Customer,I was rooting for the creatures -meh,"Okay, this is the first part of what seems to be a five part creaturathon.PROS: I liked some of the characters (the wife of the jerk and her handyman 'friend' - unfortunately they have only small parts in this first book) and who doesn't enjoy it when drunken jocks and coeds meet blood-thirsty creatures. Plus the author has certainly invented some crazy ways for a creature to off a human.CONS: I didn't like most of the characters, I thought they were too stereotypical: the 'nice guy' wimp who isn't getting the girl, the beautiful 'smart' girl who is the object of his attention, the macho girl who gets things done, the jerk husband who treats his wife like shit while cheating on her with young codes, the drunken animal house rejects, oh and the creatures who want to eat them all. My BIGGEST peeve with this installment (and with many horror  novels and movies) is that the creatures are complete predators and kill people with a swipe of their claw but somehow they can never get their hands on the story protagonists. Its just too much, I was rooting for the creatures just to clean the character slate.Now if you like straight carnage + teenage emotions, you might like this. It was a little amusing in spots but sorry, I just didn't like it",2

B00H0P5F0I,A3F5M28IHV3F83,"02 10, 2014",Robin (Sizzling Hot Books),Potential but has problems,"I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.Have you ever read a book with terrific reviews only to wonder if you are read the same book? That is unfortunately how I felt after reading High by Zara Cox. While I did enjoy parts of the book, there were definite problems that keep me from giving it five stars.If you&#8217;re going to read High, you need to be prepared to check your common sense at the door. The premise is that a fleet of executive jets, the Indigo Lounge, exist to serve as exclusive sky-high pleasure places. Bethany Green is fortunate enough to receive one of the golden tickets to take this erotic ride. Zachary Savage, Indigo Lounge owner and all-around sexy billionaire, takes one look at Bethany and decides he must have her &#8211; now!Bethany agrees to leave the Indigo Lounge and travel with Zachary to his home. It is there that we learn that Zachary is keeping secrets and while Bethany realizes that he is not telling her, she still enters into a sexual relationship with him.The characters were the biggest reason that I had problems with High. First of all, I didn&#8217;t fully understand Bethany&#8217;s character or her motivation. She is described as drop-dead gorgeous with a stunning face and sexy body. She lacks confidence despite her looks and is surprised about Zachary&#8217;s fascination with her. It made no sense for her to act so completely out of character and run off with Zachary and I found it difficult to respect her when she allowed him to keep secrets from her while embarking on a relationship.Zachary was so far out there that it didn&#8217;t matter how handsome, sexy or rich he was. His dialogue often left me rolling my eyes because people just do not talk like that. Then there is the matter that these two have known each other for less than five minutes and Zachary is staking his claim.&#8220;You can call me Zach because Zachary is too long for the many times I intend for you to scream my name when I make you come.&#8221;There are some terrific parts about High. Ms. Cox did a wonderful job describing the different locales. And the sex scenes were hot! My favorite part is the wonderful relationship that Bethany has with her best friend Keely. Keely is fantastic and would win the award for greatest best friend. We would all benefit from having a friend like Keely to push us out of our comfort zone and still be a shoulder to cry on.High has a lot of potential with an interesting storyline. But it would definitely benefit from fixing the unrealistic dialogue and further development of the characters. Fair warning, High ends on a cliff-hanger so if you don&#8217;t like open-ended books, you may want to wait until the second installment Higher is released.",2

It was slightly better, especially toward the end. But not enough so to elevate it above a two star rating in my opinion.I think I hate Regan even more than I did in the first book. She continues to annoy me and her constant flip flopping behavior leaves me uncertain of who she really is. I liked Colter the first time around, but my feelings toward him have cooled considerably with this book. He walks around angry all the time, going off into rages and hitting people who are supposed to be his 'family', and he's completely oblivious that Regan, the girl who is supposed to be his soul mate, is struggling with losing her soul to darkness.I liked Parker, who was at least a mostly consist character and a mildly interesting one. Although, I can't figure how his feelings towards Regan changed so abruptly. Or maybe they didn't. It's kind of hard to tell.There were some nice twists in this book that I didn't expect. One thing Relinquish will do is surprise you. The story itself continues to be interesting and if I wasn't so put out with the characters, I probably would have rated the book higher.",2

The author's purpose when they write a book is to entice the reader into wanting to follow through and finish the book, but Mac Flynn didn't do that.

Both Flynn and Evie had been cheated on and humiliated. Flynn knew about being controlled by a sociopathic father, and Evie was controlled by her ass of a ex-boyfriend. Because both of their relationships ended horribly they both separately moved to Alaska to take some time to heal. Unfortunately that is where their good sense ended. Especially Evie's.The idea that they fell in love after knowing each other for about a week and going on one date was ridiculous, even for Flynn the wolf. There was nothing in the book that said Flynn had some mystical mate sense, and he was engaged in the past. His former mate/fianc&eacute; cheated on him and he couldn't scent it on her, so much for animal instincts. Which means wolf and all Flynn is bumbling through life looking for love like the rest of us. Evie was in a extremely emotionally abusive relationship. When she meets Flynn he is a bit awkward and demanding. That alone should have sent her running for the hills. Instead she declares her love for him in spite of his nature and the danger being with him presents. After one date. I also wish the werewolf thing had been explained. Are only males wolves? Are there other packs? If there are why didn't any of them intervene and stop Rupert?The book does not end in a cliff hanger, but the source of true danger is not actually dealt with. I suppose it was necessary to leave a villain for the next story. The villain Rupert, Flynn's father annoyed me because he was just evil for no reason.

That said, there were several off-putting items here, and the first is, in my opinion, a doozy:1)  In the early chapters where the author gives her arguments as to why the beauty business is bad and why all natural products are good, her arguments really push the line.  They're so extreme that it discredits her as a source of information.  For example, she lists diatomaceous earth (DE) as a ""naturally unnatural"" beauty product because it is an ingredient used in dynamite and cat litter.  Well did you know DE also has many reputed health benefits and is a supplement that many people take orally on a daily basis to lower cholesterol, lower high blood pressure, as a supplemental source of silica (which most people are deficient in) among many other things?Her scathing comments on the various types of fats and other substances used in beauty products and how the companies obtain these ingredients are just as disappointing.  Yes, the truth behind where some ingredients come from (and the beauty industry is NOT alone) IS tragic, but there are also many highly ethical and responsible companies within the beauty industry as well.  Furthermore, there is just as much finger pointing that could be done towards many of the ingredients the author lists for her recipes.  Have any idea of how much death and destruction occurs with ""harvesting"" (and I mean that in the broadest sense) and making harvestable land for exotic oils (including the suspension oils she uses)?  For that matter, where does your calcium or long chain fatty acid/OMEGA supplement come from?  Some are ethical, but many are not.Some of the things she lists like bull's semen, which was a luxury fad (hair treatment) at certain very trendy European salons for a few years, she makes seem an epidemic where there's now no commercial product safe from bull semen, placenta and foreskins.  The truth is that whether it's right or wrong to use these ingredients in beauty products, most people are not able to afford the extreme luxury products that contain these types of ingredients in them.  Rest assured, your bottle of Pantene, though full of ""cones"" and other frowned upon chemicals by many in the ""all natural"" set, it is free of bull's semen.And some of the items she lists in the ""ingredients to avoid at all costs""?  For example, thimerasol:  yes, it is an organomercury compound that has been called into question in recent years for it's use as a preservative in vaccines.  Since, it has been removed from most vaccines administered to pregnant women and infants.  This compound has been used in vaccines since around the 1930's and is also found in small quantities in eye, nasal and other type products because of its anti-fungal and antiseptic properties.  The author references thimerasol in regards to its use specifically in mascara and states, ""This dangerous chemical found in your go-to tube can even cause brain damage.""I do wish that thimerasol was NOT used in mascara but it is applied to the hair shaft (dead tissue) and the most likely complaint from those who are sensitive is that mascaras with this compound may cause some localized skin irritation.  I dare the author to find a single case of human brain damage caused by the use of MASCARA containing thimerasol.  This is the kind of sensational reporting that causes people to become grossly misinformed and state as fact something that is only minimally accurate and not even of marginal value because of it's complete lack of proper, comparative context.These are just a few of many of her flawed arguments.  It's like saying, ""BEWARE, the water in your drinking glass will kill you!""  The statement is minimally accurate - ingestion of excessive amounts of water can cause a condition called hyponatremia which is the result of very low electrolyte levels that can cause brain swelling (among other things) and eventually death.  Yet I could never get away with the above statement and not be laughed out of the room.But I digress.  I will conclude simply by saying the author's accusatory tone and poorly positioned ""proof"" in her opening chapters (which is really just an angry rant blasting the beauty industry as opposed to logical/valid argument) makes her seem at best, too lazy to do real research and consequently report contextually accurate facts or at worst, a sensationalist bent on spreading ignorance.  Either way, her credibility is lost.2)  The actual recipes are fine and ingredients are easily obtained.  That said, there's nothing ground breaking here.  I do wish there was more consistency in the author advising which mask or lotion, etc was good for a given application.  Is the honey mask good for dry skin?  What mask will be good for redness, etc.  Some recipes include this advice, others just give the recipe with no other information.  For example, I know that lemon juice can be drying on the skin.  In addition it can cause sensitivity to sunlight, but this information was not included.  Thankfully, I know this but not everyone who reads the book will.  How much is too much (or too often) with the recipes that contain lemon?  Are there other ingredients that should be used with caution?  What if I get some of the lotion that contains frankincense oil into my eyes?  etc...Finally, I thought the current price of the book ($7+) quite extraordinary especially taking into account that a portion of the recipes are ones that can be found for free at various places on the internet or Youtube.My constructive criticism is over a piece of work that exhibits possibilities and I certainly commend any effort towards conscientiousness and ""natural"" living.  With some re-work of the earlier chapters and enhancement of the recipes, this could be a four or five star read. However, in its present state, I just can't recommend this one.  The first few chapters made me so angry it aged me ten years and the recipes, though fine, were mostly common and quite lacking in helpful advice.",2

That being said, I won't continue on with the After Forever/Bisexual Billionaire series.If you are looking for character development or even a plot, you won't find it in Careless. Not that I'm complaining about that. The novella is 54 pages so I wasn't expecting a lot in the development front but I did expect more than I got. In all honesty, you learn more about Kimberly, Samuel, and Nelson from the book blurb. Kimberly and Samuel are in love with one another but are best friends and have no clue the other feels the way they do. Instead they just pine for one another. Nelson, the new guy in town, is on-the-outside-looking-in and notices it all so he propositions the two of them to a night of debauchery.While Careless, the first novella in the After Forever/Bisexual Billionaire series was wickedly hot, it wasn't enough to keep me interested in the series as a whole. Especially the way it ended. I'm sure Ms. Peitsche hoped the ending would grab readers but it just annoyed me as I found Samuel to be an douche to the nth degree. Because of him acting the way he did for what I felt was a stupid reason, I honestly don't think I want to read more about him.If you are looking for something short, hot, directly to the point, and don't mind m&eacute;nage and/or male/male scenes, then Careless just might work for you.

Miller ""Greyhawk""",More social justice praise of the peasant life,"I read the reviews and many of them praised the ""science"" and ""research"" that went intoPeak Erectile Strength Diet, but after reading this short, interesting tract I can find neither science nor research on these pages.  There is nothing here but bold, unfounded assertions based on the typical social justice meme that seeks to perpetuate the lifestyle of subsistence farming peasantry at the cost of everything modern and everything truly scientific.The recommendations that so many people praised with such blissful closed-minded endorsement are pretty simple:1. Exercise more2. Eat organic foods3. Become a vegan or as close to it as you can tolerateWhile these suggestions are indeed fitting and appropriate for the descendants of French, Indian, Chinese, and Spanish peasants, the rest of us cannot survive on such meager fare.  If these ideas were so very helpful to the peasants, then why did they work so hard to abandon their ancient ""healthy"" lifestyles in favor of rebellion, destruction of the aristocracy, and modern living?  A vegan diet leaves a person physically weakened, emotionally impaired, and dependent on someone else for daily guidance.  In short, it creates peasants and there is a profound move through the modern world to convince you and I and everyone they can reach that we need to become peasants who do nothing but slave away in the factories and commercial farms established by the modern elitists for the benefit of the elitists.Early onset erectile dysfunction is founded in genetics. It is the result of countless generations of humanity that did not live beyond thirty years of age because their world was violent and their climate harsh.  While diet may, in some cases, have a minor impact on erectile function, it will never have the huge impact books like this one are claiming it will have.  The reason a starvation diet and hard exercise can, in some cases, bring minor improvement to reproductive function is because it stresses the physical animal beyond enduring and forces the genes to seek to reproduce in a younger, stronger specimen.The suggestions in this book will be helpful, but they will not transform an impotent or semi-impotent fifty or sixty year old into a breeding stud capable of marathon sex sessions.  Such claims are hyperbolic at best and downright deceptive at worst.  It is a pleasant lie designed to convince men to abandon their core strengths and become mild-mannered urban dwellers who won't argue with police and will consistently vote for bigger government and more government intervention into their daily life.If you truly want to know why your body is failing at forty, then you need to be readingThe Selfish Gene,Principles of Paleontology, andHard Evidence: Case Studies in Forensic Anthropology.The one thing the writer does get right is that replacing the candy bars and ice cream in your diet with dried fruit and dry roasted nuts will do wonders for your emotional life, your physical life, and your sex life.

This threw me out of the story...""","Tessa Crawford, a sweet, vulnerable girl who rose from a very difficult childhood to become the assistant to Alexander Worth, CEO of Worth Luxury Goods.  Tessa finds herself attracted to her boss, but knows that things can't go anywhere as she is his employee and she is not his type!  Alexander shares a deep attraction for Tessa as well, but something holds him back.  However, the line blurs while they are together on a European business trip, and Tessa is counting on things changing when they return to the States.  Yet when they return, she soon finds out that Alex didn't trust her as much as she had hoped he did and, without trust, what kind of relationship can they hope to build?  Fleeing from accusations of spying within the country, Tessa embarks on a new life without the man she loves.  She never dreams their paths will cross again, as Alex never seemed to be involved emotionally ...or was he?  Soon, Alex realizes his mistakes in believing the worst, but can he put things right, or will he discover that Tessa could be just as calculating as he had once accused her of being?Worth the Scandal was an engrossing, contemporary read that kept me involved in the story until the last page was turned.  However, there were several things that bothered me about Worth the Scandal.Tessa was very juvenile in some of her volatile reactions at varying points in Worth the Scandal.  Some things seemed a bit contrived and didn't always make sense other than ways to force these two together or back together.  Alex continually talks about how trustworthy and wholesome Tessa appears to be, that she isn't calculating and savvy enough to be a spy, that she is very loyal, and that she is too softhearted as well.  All of that made his belief of her being the spy a bit dumbfounding!  Alex even claimed that he would perform his own investigation and yet he doesn't.  Some of his thoughts in Worth the Scandal don't always stay on track, but instead cavort about randomly with no rhyme or reason.I never fully got the resolution for Alex's lack of trust and allowing people close either.  I kept waiting for that explanation, but all to no avail.  There were a couple of incidents in Worth the Scandal where I felt that his lack of faith would have been better served, but the ball was dropped.  For instance, the digging up of things by the press could have been taken into account and made his lack of trust of her more believable, or her being so softhearted and someone taking advantage of her.  Yet these were left dangling in the wind.Tessa doesn't fully trust him and wonders if he will treat her differently at work, but it kept feeling more like she thought he should treat her differently when they returned to the office in Worth the Scandal.  The whole spy thing felt more like a plot device and wasn't fully resolved for me either.  I wondered about the company the Worth brothers were running as well, given their comments about Tessa.Worth the Scandal had Alex thinking that Tessa used him for information and this didn't make any sense either given that he didn't give her anything and he took from her!  Also, she is his assistant.  She would have access to everything as well.  Alex never pursues things legally, either, in Worth the Scandal.  Alex is thinking that he gave virginal Tessa his body, and I felt he was being a bit melodramatic given the fact that at one point he is thinking about another woman he was with before.Flash forward a year and Alex is pretty remorseful and he actually does a good grovel in his thoughts.  However, this doesn't seem to see the light of day when the opportunity arises in Worth the Scandal.  Instead, he sees how she really betrayed him and he wants to make her pay.  I couldn't believe that Alex would be airing his dirty laundry in a taxi either, especially since his younger brother gives the press enough to talk about already.There was a character that just drops in out of the blue even though they were never really mentioned before in Worth the Scandal, and I wasn't even sure what this character's dream was.  Tessa believes that Alex is a ruthless man towards the end, but I never saw evidence of that either.  I think it is more a problem of her needing to grow up.There was a huge glaring error in Worth the Scandal for me involving a peripheral character's name that had suddenly changed.  This threw me out of the story.  Also Alex's younger brother seems to age very quickly while Alex is away on the business trip, and I'm not talking emotionally aging either.Reviewed by VanessaFor Joyfully Reviewed",2

B004OR192I,A91Z0PZ4TOUOC,"10 14, 2011",Steve Thomas,"Fun Book, But Not Too Useful","When I read a cookbook that calls for envelopes of Hidden Valley Ranch dip mix, or cans of mushroom soup concentrate, I always wonder ""Did I waste a bunch of money for recipes that were originally published in advertising?""It's one thing to make do with convenience items when you're really pressed for time and your pantry is empty, but planning ahead to use those items is really dumb. Mushroom soup makes a convenient sauce, saving all of 2 minutes while cooking, at an extra cost of 75c, resulting in less tasty food. The $22.50/hour that 2 minutes is higher than you'd net from a $90,000 job, after taxes and work expenses.On the other hand, the recipes all look like they'd produce tasty foods, if you have no objection to consuming chemicals that never saw the inside of your great-grandmother's kitchen.Cookbooks, however, serve a variety of different purposes. Some cookbooks teach cooking skills. This one does not. Some cookbooks serve as an encyclopedic reference so you can find out how to make a food you've never made before. This one does not. Some cookbooks are fun to page through, and serve to inspire us, when we cannot figure out what to fix. This cookbook hits that one right on the head. Even if we don't fix the particular recipe in the cookbook, cookbook might give us an idea of what to do with the food ingredient in the refrigerator that will go bad if we don't use it pretty soon.And this IS a fun cookbook. There's an amusing quip between each two recipes. (""Families are like fudge - mostly sweet with a few nuts."" The cookbook is fairly well organized, with each recipe starting on a new page. The artistic design is excellent, there are few if any typos in the words, suggesting that there aren't many places where they specify a tablespoon of arsenic when they meant a teaspoon of alum (drat, and I DID so like Aunt Alice!). They even get the grammar right.And the author obviously has a sense of humor. Unfortunately, that comes out in the names of the recipes. If you're watching TV with your loved one, and leisurely paging through cookbooks during commercials, trying to compose a shopping list, that's one thing. If you suddenly realize that you need to fix supper, because Joe raided the refrigerator at 3 AM, and you no longer have those leftovers you were counting on, you may need to scour through the table of contents of a dozen or more cookbooks, trying to figure out what you can fix that sounds good, with the ingredients you have on hand.It's at that point that ""Life Sucks Golf Balls Casserole"" ceases being a cutesy menu item, ""Chloe's Chicken Salad (which she stole from Phoebe)"" becomes more acceptable and ""Cashew Chicken Salad"" (all three are recipes in this cookbook) becomes absolutely fantastic as a name for a recipe.I've spoken mostly of being inspired by this cookbook, but I intend to try ""Not Yo Mama's Apple Pie"" in the next couple of days. Not without modification, of course. The author calls for shortening in the pie crust, and as I want neither cancer nor heart disease, I will use healthful rendered lard instead of the trans-fat-laden shortening. It's a very similar recipe to the one I normally use, though, and if it's a little better, I'm always happy to steal a good idea.""A conclusion,"" one of the interstitial notes points out, ""is the place you get to when you're tired of thinking."" I'm tired of thinking. And while I can hardly call this a great cookbook for everyone, it certainly has its good points, and depending on your needs, may be a great cookbook for you.(There are previews of a couple of romance novels included, but if you wanted those, you could get the free samples of the books from the Kindle store without the bother of a cookbook.)",2

Four stars for the series.I started the Forced to Serve series with the free Amazon download of The Demon of Synar and have read all of the series to date.  It's a space opera, with a little action and a lot of personal interaction between the characters.  What I like about this series is that Ms. McDonald portrays the characters as aliens but it turns out that they are not that different from us humans.  That is, only one of the characters has any human DNA and the rest originate from worlds far beyond Earth.  Several of the non-humans appear to be far more enlightened than humanity, but that is probably due to their very long lives.  Not to worry, there are worlds that are certainly less enlightened, assuming you believe slavery to be a bad thing.In The Healers Kiss, Boca and Chiang have been fated for each other by the Creators.  But neither wants to commit. Yes, this theme has been done before.  Yes, I did get a little annoyed with their refusal to see the light since everyone else on board the ship keeps pointing them to it.  However, both characters still endeared themselves to me as each was fully developed and each had their own redeeming characteristics.Along with the theme of the uncommitting lovers is the action side of this story where Boca and Chiang go under cover to rescue a dignitary's daughter who has been captured and is being kept as a slave.  They are assisted by familiar characters from the previous installments in this series: Captain Synar and Ania Looren, the Demon Malachi, Dorian and Gwen Jet.  With the introduction of a few new characters, we are being prepared for the next book in the series.This was an enjoyable read and I look forward to the next in the series.",3

That will change when he realised they aren't the only ones fishing.Erik Gustafson's The Fishers is a decent taster to a full length novel, but the fact this isn't mentioned as being a taster is a bit annoying in my opinion. Some tasters are okay if they read like standalone short stories, because readers who aren't that into it still leave satisfied even though they don't plan on reading the whole novel and those who got into the characters or got hooked on the plot can buy the complete novel if they want to.  The Fishers although obviously an amateurly written story, was an okay basic plot and tale that with an editor involved down the track could be professionally published. It would have been better written through Dave the sons eyes, rather than switching between being inside his head and telling the story as third person narrator style. I found it a bit annoying that the father was referred to as Greg or Dad depending on whose eyes, Dave or the invisible narrator we were experiencing events through.The Fishers didn't actually seem like it was going to be a taster until the end when a completely new element is added in the final paragraph, especially the last sentence, which just has the reader asking themselves, what?.  Then the author tells us to read, I won't give away that title actually as it gives away the ending of this, but I just found suddenly finding out this was a taster to be a real letdown. If the story had ended moments before it did Gustafson could have left things up to the reader to imagine the aftermath to the events.

I could tell that they were the perfect fit to heal each other's wounds. I just wish that they had been given a full story to flesh out all the complexities Kent gives them. While the novella felt complete...the reader in me itched for a little more time. Maybe Kent will re-release in time as a longer work.

The descriptions are well done, the dialogue is well done, the sex scenes are not bad. I've heard a couple of people complain that the age difference between the characters put them off. I didn't have a problem with it. In this entire story, Ethan's character is perhaps the most realistic one. Jon comes very close; you are more likely to see him as an actual person when he's being a douche. As a result, by the end, you are left with a vaguely unsettled feeling about them as a couple, despite the happy ending.

Sounds like HEA to me!","Plot:The only way to warm Kate after her car rolled into the river was naked between two hot cowboys. One thing leads to another and a hot and steamy snowed in weekend follows. But can it be for keeps?Comments:- 1833 kindle locations, but winds up around 1580.- m/f/m, m/f, m/m. Generous, lusty, fun, varied. No bdsm, toys or any other accessories. A different take on the m/m - they are cowboys who spend long winters together and don't mind helping each other out. But never saw themselves as a committed couple. While we start out as a fun menage for a few days, we end up aiming for a committed threesome.Opinion:Erotic contemporary cowboy menage with lots of revenge sex and a nice HEA. This is a nice little book but it isn't anything spectacular. It is disappointingly short, but it is complete. Nothing is left to be said. All plot strands are wound up. I like the ending, I like that Kate is given the opportunity to make an intelligent, considered decision (so unusual in these books!) and I like that it is simply a Naughty Weekend that just maybe takes us to Forever. There are no Bad Guys, no-one is Wounded, no Angst. We simply get lots of sex and then a HEA (with more sex *grin*). It is what it is.Aside:The m/m instance is a little more uncomfortable than I expected. I have read m/m where they are committed and ready and willing to go for it when the opportunity arises. It is natural. I have read m/m where at a point during the menage a decision is made to test the waters and hey! look at that! we like it. It's organic. But ""Saddled"" is a little different. More forced. The men aren't so willing to go down that path with Kate there (although they have in private). And the issue is somewhat taken out of their hands by the games they are playing. It changes the dynamic. No one is ""forced"" but IMO it gets a little grey and drops this from a low 4 stars to a high 3.-CR-",3

Flaws make people real and bring books to life and Made a Killing's protagonists certainly possess them.This is all very positive so why aren't I giving this a 'five' like everyone else?Well, I persevered with the story rather than enjoyed it and that's a million miles from what I'd hoped for from this book. In fact I almost gave up after a couple of pages because of the confusing grammar. Commas, apostrophes and the other devices which help a reader were frequently misused or just missing altogether. I know that it makes me sound a pedant saying this but, in order to enjoy a book, one has to lose oneself in it. If you have to keep stopping and starting in order to make sense of what's just gone before, that's the moment lost.There were also too many references to TV cop programmes - a weak attempt at persuading the reader that your story is the realistic one. I'd urge the author to cut it back to just one jokey comment. Less is always more.I'm also docking a star because the end was a clich&eacute; with the 'bad guy' being unable to contain themselves when it came to spilling the beans on their dark secrets (unrealistic). The car chase was a bit 'OTT' too. Here we are making jibes at TV cop shows and we end up with burning rubber.On balance, if the system would let me, I'd give 'Made a Killing' 7 out of 10 and that's not bad.In summary, the story's good (I loved the main victim and would have liked to hear much more about his antics) - it just needs a bit of editing.",3

B00DS7SYVY,A1I6BG5XRGOUJJ,"02 9, 2014",Annie Athens,Total Power Corrupts,"I did find this book interesting but as others have already mentioned, it tended to skim over the surface and we really needed more in depth details of social life, services etc. for the population at that period in time.  I did note that there are Romanians now wishing they had the security they had during that period, housing, jobs food on the table and I have heard similar reports from other Eastern block countries. I also thought that it jumped about too much from different periods and would have been easier perhaps to understand this period better if the each chapter in the book had related to a period in time from his rise to power to Christmas Day.Living in Greece for 35 years has brought home to me just how closely  related we in the Balkan countries are  compared to Northern Europeans.  I have found here that same sheep like attitude of following  a leader that tells his people what they want to hear rather than the plain truth.  Here in Greece it has always been the aim of the vast majority of Greeks to find a position in the public services rather than persue a career in private enterprise or even their own venture.  Is this due to history, the instability in the respective countries that citizens seek security rather than to be adventurous and work to achieve a goal in life.Of course total power does corrupt and  this is exactly the problems we have here in Greece and why  we are living in a bankrupt country relying on loans.  When there is only one House of Parliament and the Presidency is stripped of all power then of course the leaches are there to benefit themselves.  The longer in power of any totalitarian  leader, the more will gather to feed from the trough.  These governments hand out positions to the faithful that keep them in power.

And while there were some slight issues with the story changing perspectives suddenly, for the most part it was told through Jerry's POV.Also, this book was way funny. I really enjoyed all the heavy (and light) banter between the friends. Yes, there was some foul language and even some crude jokes but these are boys and as they say, boys will be boys.I really liked the way this story went. It was a different spin on an old tale. Yes there were vampires, some good and some bad but the angle of the story was different, Jerry was different. He had flaws and he knew it. No one expected him to be perfect. His friends and family weren't perfect and that was okay. The flaws worked.I really enjoyed the background info on the vamps, how they were born and how they were created (some of it was even a little humorous).

B00A94D748,A310KT1UQC5UNU,"05 1, 2014",Reading Fanatic (CMP),"Hot Sex, Too-Modern Language, Ok Story","This book is set in 1816, India.  Both protagonists, Elizabeth Thornton and Maxwell Harrison (Beth and Max) during historical times, with protagonists that are both English.  Max works for a very powerful, very perverse, man named Jeeval, who has a harem of women who he uses and abuses for his sexual pleasure.  Although some of the women he ""owns"" he had received as gifts, while others were purchased as slaves, many others were kidnapped.  Maxwell's job is to train the women in the art of erotic and sadistic pleasures which includes rape.  Maxwell also procures women for Jeeval by snatching them off the streets.Clearly Max is not a very nice man--an understatement that for a man who is a kidnapper and rapist--but fortunately, we meet him when he has already set his sights Elizabeth as his next victim--I say fortunately because pretty much as soon as he kidnaps Beth his character begins to reform.  Elizabeth, a gently-reared young woman, is in India working with the Baptist Mission Society.  After stalking Elizabeth for weeks, Max executes his planned ruse and kidnaps her, taking her back to Jeeval's estate. Almost from the beginning, Maxwell is beguiled by the tiny, fiery beauty.  He doesn't understand the feelings of tenderness fiery female.It is Max's job to relieve Elizabeth of her virginity and turn her into the perfect sex slave.  But, very quickly he finds that he cannot conceive of any other man laying claim to ""his"" Beth.  Nevertheless, Max's hands are tied and there is nothing he can do to protect Elizabeth so long as they are both within the walls of Jamal's estate.  Consequently, the two must find a way to escape.  A plan is hatched and subsequently executed whereby the two escape.  The rest of the book consists of Max and Elizabeth's flight from India en route to England and safety.While the story is fairly interesting and the sex scenes super hot, I had a lot of issue with the book.  For one, the story was inundated with modern jargon.  Maxwell consistently uses words such as, ""gonna"", ""honey"", ""luv"", and ""baby"", and others, it was so bad that every time he opened his mouth I kept hearing a very modern, very American voice in my head.  It was extremely jarring and kept dragging me out of the story.Furthermore, IMO the book ended too abruptly.  While I don't exactly agree with the reviewer who said that the book ends on a cliffhanger, I must admit that the ending isn't quite satisfactory.  When the book story ends, Max and Beth have safely fled India.  However, they are far from safe, as Jeeval's power and influence are far-reaching.The book ends with the couple about to embark on a 60+ mile (more than 100 kilometers according to the book) trek over rough terrain with little water, without the use of horses.  The plan is to walk to Saldana Bay where they will meet up with a ship that will provide them safe passage to England.  Had the story left Max and Elizabeth in present day where it had, but included an epilogue portraying the couple at some future point--preferably at least a year down the road--that would have served to answer any concerns I might have had about their safety and future happiness.I also had some doubt as to the depth of Elizabeth's love for Max.  The two fell in love within a matter of days, and while I didn't have an issue with Max's falling in love with Elizabeth, I did have some lingering concerns about hers for him.  I couldn't help wondering if she wasn't suffering from a case of Stockholm Syndrome.  An epilogue depicting the couple together and happy at some point in the not too near future, would have served to quell that concern.Bottom line, this book was entertaining.  It is also very well written, and Max and Elizabeth's characters are relatable.  The author did a really nice job of redeeming Max's character as the story progressed--no mean feat that!  The book certainly isn't for the faint of heart, as some of the scenes portrayed are very disturbing.  Nonetheless, if you're looking for a hot BDSM novel and don't care about the rest of it, this book might fit the bill.  Happy reading!",3

B008VIJNL0,A34AFYDY8PXD9R,"09 4, 2013",Meg,"Christian fiction with a lot of heart, but not always smooth reading","The blurb led me to believe that this story would be primarily a romance. It should be noted that this is not the case. The romance between Richard and Carol takes place entirely between the lines. In fact, Richard doesn't have much page time and I wouldn't call him the main character.What this book is really about is a large Christian family living in Oregon during the western expansion. This novel and the characters within it are defined by their Christianity. As they face the ups and downs of life, they turn to prayer and scripture. Many of the characters are children (though I did struggle to nail down their ages), and the story frequently centers around the lessons they learn from their own errors and from their family, all leading to a greater understanding of the Bible.  As such, the novel relies heavily on direct quotes from scripture.  If you are looking for a story about a large loving family who regularly discuss and expand upon their Christian faith, than you will likely enjoy this novel.My issues with the book were mostly with the execution. Their are many characters and the POV switches continually. Some scenes jump from head to head to head with such rapidity and linger so briefly that I was left feeling confused and detached. The timeline is also confusing, as it jumps forward and backwards, and I was frequently unsure whether I was reading the present or a flashback/flashforward. With such a vast cast of characters and so much jumping around I found it hard to feel really immersed in the story. It seemed too stretched out and lacking in focus. I also stumbled over frequent grammatical issues and typos. An additional round of editing would serve this novel well.Despite all of this, the book does sustain a strong sense of morality and love, which will appeal to readers who seek parabolic fiction.",3

She&#8217;s growing closer and closer to the virtual stranger she married, and while she though she had no place for him in her life, he&#8217;s fitting in unexpectedly well.  He may have been looking to freeload off a successful woman, but he&#8217;s already establishing himself as a personal trainer.And now that her status has changed from single to married, Valerie&#8217;s career is about to change as well.  Her friends from work, the ones from which she&#8217;s still learning the publicist ropes, are splitting off and launching their own company.  And they want Valerie to come with them.  The opportunities will be greater, the potential for a bigger salary will be greater, and the chances she&#8217;ll have to work with her former pseudo-friend-with-benefits might just turn into one big headache.She&#8217;s falling more and more in love with Wes with each day that goes by, but can she really maintain a professional relationship with Maxwell and still hang onto Wes?  Not if Max keeps tossing his money and power around to undermine Wes.The Verdict...This &#8220;episode&#8221; didn&#8217;t turn out at all the way I thought it would, and I&#8217;m sooooo glad.  The summary made it seem like the perfect recipe for a gigantic, jealous misunderstanding a little too early for Wes and Valerie, too far before these two have worked out their feelings for each other.  They&#8217;re both struggling to find their way, but they&#8217;re not being hot-headed about it.  I&#8217;m not suggesting it won&#8217;t play out that way in the next book, and given that Max is still hanging around, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me, but so far it&#8217;s paced out to be more believable than the standard cliche.The lack of heavy drama in some ways made this book feel more like filler than forward movement.  It&#8217;s not empty filler, though.  Instead, it&#8217;s a subtle step in the right direction, allowing the characters to better establish things and begin admitting &#8212; at least to themselves &#8212; that a quickie wedding might just be the best thing that&#8217;s ever happened to them.

It was like the Perils of Pauline in that something like a soap opera plot was always happening to Nina.  She meets Tristan Stone at the art gallery she is serving cocktail weiners to wannabe art patrons.  Little does she know that Tristan Stone is there to meet her and it is all about the mysterious murder of her Dad.  I liked Nina, but come on...no one is that naive.  Tristan was a wealthy party boy putting coke up his nose before his family's death in a plane crash and that is his default when things get rough.  He never asks what Nina wants, he just decides for both of them and is usually wrong.  He also never comes clean with her and always has another secret even though he swears he has told her everything and she keeps taking him back.I know a lot of you hate these reviews, but what looks so romantic with the tortured hero on paper is not the kind of thing you want in your life.  Anyone who defaults to drugs has demons he refuses to deal with.  Being stoned out of your mind for months while someone worries about whether you are still alive or still care for them is an unnecessary torture.  I like Nina because she is warm and caring, but I wish she would grow up.  I could not get close to Tristen, because he was so closed off and had more problems than most women would take on.  This was not my kind of series, but all three books are included and it might be your idea of a good read.",3
B00KB46MKM,A223D9Q6D5F1CA,"06 16, 2014",LaurieHere dot com - Contemporary Fiction and...,Hilarious for a Single! Nice escape from reality!,"This last Sunday, yesterday, after seeing an advertisement on my Kindle, I used my Prime membership to 'borrow' a book, taking some time out for 'myself' to read something I wanted to read instead of a 'book for review'.How strange, huh! I plan on doing this very same thing in the month of September, too. NO review books, only books &#34;I&#34; want to read from my TBR PILES UPON PILES! (I'm sure I'll have a few 'for review' books I need to read in there, but that's okay.) So, here we go!If you have not taken the time to try &#34;Borrowing&#34; out yet, it is painless! (LOL!) I just clicked on 'Borrow' and it told me I cannot 'borrow' another book until July 1st, Hmmm? That is a little longer than when Amazon says you can borrow a book for '2 weeks' in their description to us, and bothered me because this is a Kindle SINGLE with only 40 pages! If I did this every month, I would call Amazon and complain about a Single being treated as a novel, for sure. Anyway, here it is:DESCRIPTION:Somewhere people act normal -- but not in the Downy Mount Mobile Home Park, where recently widowed Marfa Bacot lives with her mother-in-law Lulu, who cleans from hell to breakfast and has her make-up tattooed on so she's always ready for the rapture. As if it's not crazy enough inside the trailer, Marfa has to deal with the other eccentrics who populate the park, from the runaway polygs stockpiling water for the end of the world to the man who hears from extra-terrestials through V-8 cans to the domineering Don Ella, who runs the park with an iron fist and attendance-mandatory parties. Marfa dreams of a new life on her own outside Flagstaff, but first she'll have to let go of her old one.Helen Childress wrote the movie &#34;Reality Bites.&#34; She is a seventh-generation Texan.My Take:3 StarsFirst, there is NOTHING NORMAL about this Single at all! It's very funny all through the book, but nothing NEAR normal! Although, from the look of the cover, to the description of the book, I was expecting that!To correct the description, Marfa's mother-in-law, Lulu, moved in with 'her' inside of this 460 square foot trailer, 40' long and 12' wide, that's it. She liked her mother-in-law, but put two eccentric people together inside of a tiny space like this, and after a bit of time, someone is going to become irritated along the way, and it was Marfa, and myself! You can only take so much of Lulu, you know!This book was hilarious in most places! Marfa's mother-in-law has a language all her own which did make this Single a little difficult to read at times, but left you thinking about what she said, and there was NO figuring out what she meant more often than not, but it was funny!Here's the reason why Marfa had to open the door for her to move in. Lulu states:&#34;Never turn anybody away , they may be Jesus - But Jesus she ain't.&#34;My favorite thing was this Sucrets container Lulu carried around with her everywhere! What was it? An ashtray! She smoked 120's because you get the most value for your money. (That's what I used to think back when I smoked! LOL!) She cleans 24/7 and NEVER stops! This irritated Marfa, and myself, again!This 40 page story was funny, but a constant funny is not always a good thing. It detracts from the story. If a little of the comedy was removed, perhaps we could have gotten to know the characters a little bit better than what we did.It's hard to do that with just a 40 page story, so I can't drop my rating because of that. This little story was meant for 'comic relief', or at least that is what it did for me! It was definitely different than what I am used to reading, for sure! I liked it. I would really like to see this book taken further and maybe even made into a full length novel. I think this author has the ability to do that, and I believe she could pull it off. Again, you have to remember, this is a Single, and it is meant to make us laugh, and laugh, I did!The author is Helen Childress. There is not much about her anywhere, and I even did a Google search about her. All that kept coming back was she wrote the movie, &#34;Reality Bites&#34; which aired in 1994. Wow! That movie has a LOT of big named Actors! Winona Ryder, Ben Stiller, Jeanne Tripplehorn (she plays an FBI agent in Criminal Minds now), and many more well known named actors. This was directed by Ben Stiller, too.I think this might be an attempt to get back into writing for Helen Childress? If so, I think she should give it a whirl!I see in other reviews my rating is probably among the highest, but I'm giving this author the benefit of the doubt. My other train of thought here was perhaps she is even writing again to get back into script writing again? There are a lot of possibilities for this author right now, and if taken the right way, I think she'll do pretty good. Now I want to re-watch the movie she wrote, Reality Bites, since I can't remember it 20 years later! LOL!",3

I'm past the ""new adult"" stage of life.  Which means I may be a bit too hard on these characters but it seemed they spent more time mooning over one another - WHILE DECIDING TO HOP INTO BED WITH OTHER FOLKS, MIND YOU - than actually communicating about discovering the misconceptions they held about each other.

The ""rock stars"" have an achromatic view on sex -- don't touch Trixie, but grab all the groupie sex you can.  (And Trixie is no better - she has Jack as her hook-up while in town - is that like having a girl in every port?)

I loved the vividness and descriptions of both the story and the characters.The interactions between Rolph and Tara were very cute. Attraction - at least on Tara's behalf - from the moment they meet and that continues on throughout the book. It was a very sweet story.My main negative about the story was the pace - it's very slow. Action wise, not much happens (until the very end) and there are times when it feels like the characters talk too much about certain topics. I didn't feel like there needed to be that many words spent in discussing travel and the vehicles they used (although I adored the term ""mechanimal"" for the mechanical horse) and all the details about the shopping trip that a few of the characters took into town. Sometimes less is more.All in all, a very sweet story and an interesting take on the old Beauty and the Beast story.",3

B0098SJUNI,A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"03 22, 2013","LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re...",Interesting Read,"Alaina Howard enters her office one morning to find the other, previously unoccupied, desk now home to a rather good looking man. After exchanging a few pleasantries with Jordan Blake, Alaina goes to her uncle to try and find out why a man with little to no computer experience was now working in an IT department. Although her uncle explains his reasons Alaina leaves his office with more questions than answers. Surprised again when Jordan takes Abe--his service dog--for a walk, Alaina finds the more she sees of her new office mate, the deeper the mysteries around him grow. Caught somewhere between curiosity and suspicion, a volatile mix of emotions grow around Alaina and Jordan, creating a bond neither can deny.Quite a number of times throughout the book I found Alaina came across as very judgmental- like her outwardly showing distaste for Jordan when she assumes (incorrectly) that he's going outside for a smoke, or when she again leaps to conclusions that because Jordan isn't blind he has ""no need"" for his service dog. Such instant reactions were in some respects understandable, but they left me with the impression that anything not crystal clear makes Alaina react with suspicion and distaste. This hit me particularly when she asked Jordan to leave his service dog behind when they go to the movies. Although Alaina didn't know just how much Jordan relies on Abe for his physical and emotional health, the fact he had kept his dog with him every minute for the weeks of time they'd spent together should have tipped her off to what a monumental thing requesting he be left behind was. It felt unthinking of her, like she assumed she knew better than Jordan himself did.I didn't find Alaina to be anything like the common heroine, but this made me more intrigued as to where the plot and interactions would go. None of her reactions were aggressive enough for me to dislike her character, but it was a brave move on the author's behalf writing her like this - and one that I feel strengthens the conflict within the story. Instead of being a wishy-washy, sunshine-and-roses style of book, it's a lot sharper and more realistic. I really liked this and found these differences in plot excellent. Some readers, however, mightn't feel the same and might find it difficult to relate to Alaina.I also particularly liked how Jordan wasn't your average hero who has made it back after time in the army. He's not lost a limb or got disfiguring scars and needs the nurture and love of a good woman to make it all right. Instead he's got a more difficult--and uncommon--problem to deal with, that of anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and a mixed bag of other issues. Again I thought this was a brave and excellent side-step from what could have become a story like many others. It made the plot feel fresh and deeply interesting to see how Alaina and Jordan would deal with things. I found myself turning the pages and deeply sunk into the story, engrossed. For those looking for a sweet story that breaks out of the more traditional roles one expects; this could well be a refreshing and wonderful read.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews",3

B00GCYPOHM,AF5LQ8IWZ2W21,"11 18, 2013",Avid Reader,Cute and Heartwarming Stories but plagued by editing issues.,"CHRISTMAS ROMANCE OF 2013 is a sweet collection of four short stories that will warm your heart and bring you some cheer during the holiday season.  Overall, I give it three stars and recommend another round of revisions, including making the page layout and formatting conducive to reading the pdf on a computer or e-reader.CHRISTMAS WISHES by Danica Winters tells the story of two people who are still grieving the loss of a significant loved one &#8211; Albert, his wife Brooke, and Lee, her son Daniel.  Albert and Lee meet at the cemetery, the graves being adjacent to one another.  A second chance meeting outside of a diner results in Albert and Lee spending Christmas together with Albert&#8217;s daughter, Penny.  Even though Christmas dinner is a disaster, these three feel the blessings of new friendships and new possibilities that go a long way to healing their broken hearts.I enjoyed CHRISTMAS WISHES because it was so appropriate for so many people.  Few people have &#8220;Normal Rockwell&#8221; Christmases, and CHRISTMAS WISHES highlights the fact that anything is possible if we give God a chance to work.  The romance is sweet, focusing on the stresses and difficulties of the holiday rather than the physical attraction between Albert and Lee.  This story is definitely a good read for teens and adults alike.  Despite a few editing issues and a page layout that isn&#8217;t conducive to either computer or e-reader, I highly recommend this story for your holiday reading.CENTRAL BARK AT CHRISTMAS by Jennifer Connor tells the story of Tennyson and Parkash, two dog lovers who meet at the dog park and bond over an abandoned dog.  Both have to gather their courage to move forward in life; Tennyson has to get over her last relationship, and Parkash has to take a stand with his father about his future in the family company.I had trouble enjoying CENTRAL BARK AT CHRISTMAS because, although the substance of the story was cute, the pervasive grammar, punctuation and editing issues seriously detracted from the story.  Inaccuracies and inconsistencies in descriptors, awkward word choices, awkward sentence and paragraph structuring, misused homonyms, incorrect or missing punctuation, subject-verb disagreements and verb-object disagreements plagued this story.  The romance was believable until the very end when both dog lovers declare their love for each other; it was just too quick and lacked enough foundational support from the plot for me to believe it.If this story were revised with a fine tooth comb and an eye for the issues noted here, the likeable characters and sweet plot could be enjoyed by teen and adult readers alike.HALO&#8217;S WISH by Sharon Kleve tells the story of Halo and Rich, another pair of animal lovers, who meet while Halo is undercover at Pemsky security, investigating Pemsky&#8217;s role in some animal abduction and ransom cases.  Rich is immediately interested in Halo, but Halo very clearly tells Rich that she can&#8217;t date him because she is focused on her career.  Pemsky is convicted, but once out of jail, he attempts to kill Halo.  Will Halo come to her senses and agree to date Rich before it&#8217;s too late?I did not enjoy Halo&#8217;s Wish.  It felt stiff and awkward.  The story had several subplot-lines that did nothing but mark time and add to the jolting feel of the story.  The Pemsky plotline seemed like the main plot, but then Pemsky fell off the page for so long, I wondered whether he was significant at all.  The characters could also use further developing.  Halo&#8217;s parents make a pre-Christmas appearance, which was an opportunity to develop Halo&#8217;s character, but in the end, it felt like their appearance was merely to explain Halo&#8217;s new Sunshine yellow car, rather than help illustrate Halo as a person.  So many opportunities to add depth to the characters were missed.My biggest issue with this story was the romance, which was so thin as to be non-existent.  Rich McFarlane is too forward to be attractive.  What is supposed to be a sexy come-on at Pemsky&#8217;s office is just creepy.  His forwardness, in reality, is assault, both criminal and civil.  Moreover, at the end of the story, Halo thinks to herself that she doesn&#8217;t know Rich McFarlane well enough to buy him a Christmas present; but apparently they know each other well enough for Rich to call her honey, and sweetie and to kiss her whenever and wherever possible?  The relationship just did not make sense to me.  It needed a lot more substance for me to believe it.Add to all of that some serious grammar and editing issues, and this was a difficult story to get through.A CHRISTMAS HOPE by Casey Dawes tells the story of Clara and Sam, two people who have suffered through the loss of a loved one around the Christmas holidays, but who have had very different reactions.  Clara is positivity incarnate and believes that celebrating the holiday is a way to honor her father.  Sam approaches the holiday like Scrooge, refusing even to acknowledge the day.  Clara and Sam meet when she approaches him with a business idea, and even though he rejects her idea at first, Clara perseveres to make her business a success, ultimately bringing Sam around to her holiday philosophy as well.At first, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of this story, but then I realized that what I was feeling was Clara&#8217;s uber-optimistic streak that her ex-husband called &#8220;flighty.&#8221;  Clara is definitely a dreamer, and I&#8217;m more pragmatic.  So it took me a bit to warm up to her.  I understood Sam&#8217;s perspective much more easily, and like Sam, I was feeling the warmth of the Christmas season before the end of the story.I&#8217;m so glad that the epilogue illustrated the time lapse between that first meeting and Clara moving to Roxbury.  It added the depth and substance of Clara and Sam&#8217;s relationship necessary to make it credible.There were some distracting editing mishaps, including places where Clara&#8217;s name was spelled Carla, but by the end of the story, I was focused more on the uplifting success of Clara&#8217;s business and growing friendships in Roxbury than I was the editing.  I definitely enjoyed this story.",3

Unfortunately, Ball fell into the writer&#8217;s trap of telling us the story instead of showing us. Putting Winter&#8217;s Romance in the Western Romance genre is a bit misleading.

Also, trigger warning for rape.)After a brief stay with her grandfather in Oregon, nine-year-old Kellie has just been reunited with her family in Austin, Texas when all hell breaks loose. The dead begin rising, only to feast on the living - and poor Kellie finds herself all alone. Well, almost. As she traverses the West Coast in search of her parents and two younger sisters, her diary ""Barbie"" proves a constant and dependable companion. In between Barbie's covers, Kellie documents the horrors she witnesses.Currently the Kellie's Diary series spans four books, with parts 1 through 3 collected in KELLIE'S DIARY: DECAY OF INNOCENCE. There are also a few ""extras,"" including a preview of a related upcoming series, Survival Chronicles:KELLIE'S DIARY, PART 1 - The dead begin rising right in the middle of Kellie's third-grade class. When a seemingly deranged man bursts through the classroom window and mauls the substitute teacher, Kellie flees into the bathroom. Once the chaos subsides, she makes the long and terrifying trek back to her home - only to find it empty. (January 18 through January 25, 1993)KELLIE'S DIARY, PART 2 - A year older and an apocalypse wiser, Kellie has spent months researching and planning a journey (back) to her grandfather's farm, where she believes she might find her parents and sisters. In California, her plans are thrown into disarray when she crosses paths with the evil Dr. Crane. Aided by a horde of zombies, Kellie manages to escape her captor - only to stumble onto a camp of survivors (and into the sights of their rifles). (December 4, 1993 through January 9, 1994)KELLIE'S DIARY, PART 3 - Reunited with her younger sister, Lydia, Kellie has all but resigned herself to the fact that the rest of her family is dead. She and Lydia live a (mostly) peaceful existence in the camp, where they're cared for by Sarah, an adoptive mother of sorts. Haunted by memories of Dr. Crane in the form of ""Bag Man,"" the walking dead remain a constant - if sometimes underappreciated - threat. That is, until the day they finally manage to breach the camp's defenses. Along with a few other refugees from the camp, the girls go on the run, only to find themselves aboard a train-bound community. While the citizens appear self-sufficient and welcoming enough, not everything is as it seems. For starters, why did two of its scavengers try to abduct Kellie and Lydia? (June 17 through ~June 22, 1995)SARAH'S DESPAIR - The beginning of the end as told from Sarah's perspective. Also an Austin native, we learn how Sarah discovered Lydia and hitched up with the other founders of the California camp.DR. CRANE - This extra introduces us to Kellie's tormentor, child psychiatrist-turned-sadist Dr. Crane. In what feels like one coincidence too many, we first meet Crane at the California camp, where he's just imprisoned, tortured, and killed two of the resident children. As the search party closes in on his trailer, Crane flees; ultimately he hitches a ride with an unsuspecting couple, landing at the mall in Junction where he'll later meet Kellie. Those unfortunate enough to encounter Crane become part of his sick experiments (the ""rebuilding process""), which involve torturing survivors of the zombie plague in order to ""cleave the weak."" Thankfully, this short story doesn't elaborate on how Crane ""tested"" Kellie (though rape is heavily suggested in Parts 2 and 3).THE DOWNFALL: SURVIVAL CHRONICLES #1 - This is a short look at a new series of ""survival horror"" that's only tangentially related to KELLIE'S DIARY (in that they take place in the same universe). 18-year-old Brandon Williams is a down-on-his-luck orphan working a crappy construction job in order to support his 13-year-old sister Danielle. He's on the job in Dallas when the apocalypse comes a-knockin'. On his way home to his sister, Brandon is bit and infected; he begins to turn right there on his front steps. And then...blackness. Brandon dies, but wakes up in a lab reborn. Neither human nor zombie, but something new. Do you remember the day you died?Although the first installment of KELLIE'S DIARY starts out rather slow, the action does pick up as the story progresses. The plot also becomes a bit darker - though not quite as bleak as I'd expected, based on some of the other reviews. (Rape is a common theme in dystopian fiction, and thankfully Kellie's assault at the hands of Dr. Crane is alluded to rather than described in detail.)While the authors approach the zombie genre using a unique perspective (through the eyes of a young girl) and format (a diary), there's not a whole lot here to distinguish the plot from other zombie stories. (In particular, the debate about whether or not the camp's children should be armed reminded me of similar arguments on THE WALKING DEAD, with Sarah standing in as KELLIE'S DIARY Carol; and the setting is evocative of Rhiannon Frater's THE FIRST DAYS: AS THE WORLD DIES.)It's a readable enough story, and I plan on downloading Part 4 if only to find out how things go sideways with the train people (as they inevitably will), but I probably won't keep up after that. My book pile's already too big as it is.Something else to note: while the individual installments are presented in a handwriting font, complete with faux college-ruled, water-stained notebook pages, the collection looks more like a regular book, complete with a less flowery font. What the collection lacks in charm and authenticity it more than makes up for in readability: this format is much easier on the eyes.Vaguely reminiscent of WARM BODIES, THE DOWNFALL: SURVIVAL CHRONICLES #1 looks promising as well (though I could do without all the gendered slurs - that is, unless we're supposed to dislike Brandon, in which case have at it!); I guess we'll have to see where it goes from here.3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 on Amazon. While an improvement over Part 1, I still feel like the series could use a little extra something to set it apart from the thousands of other zombie stories out there.",3

You get to see a little piece of Nick's life and some of his struggles.Opening Sentence: Nick Merrick sat on his bed and ran his thumb along the edge of the sealed envelope.The Review:Nick Merrick is the peace marker in his family.  Living with his brothers and no parents, Nick has been the one that everyone relies on.  He tries to help his family in any way that he can but he also has kept secrets from them.  Nick has been dating Quinn for a little while now and he really likes her, but he doesn't feel any electricity with her or any other girl for that matter.  He soon meets Quinn's dance partner Adam, and Nick starts to have feelings that he has always tried to hide.  No one will understand how he is feeling, especially his brothers.Nick is a sweet character and I feel bad for him.  He has spent his whole life being something he's not because he is scared of what others will think.  He seems like a really nice guy and a good friend.  He treats Quinn really good and I thought that their relationship was really cute, even if there wasn't really any chemistry between them.  I liked Nick, this just gave us a taste of his story and I am interested to get to know him better in his own book that is coming in the future.Quinn was my favorite part of this story.  She is spunky and has a temper, but underneath that she is very insecure.  She has quite a reputation with the boys and she likes that Nick has always been a gentleman around her.  She has some serious family and self- esteem issues that she needs to work out, but that made her interesting to me.  I hope to see more of her in future books.This was a really fun read.  I enjoyed the characters and the story was cute.  I really enjoy novellas in series because it gives you something to tide you over while you wait for the next book to come out, and this did that perfectly.

Nick promised he'd return and despite bad news from the U.S. military, she'd never lost hope tht he was alive and celebrated his life every chance she got.It had been more than 20 years since NAVY SEAL Nicholas Klaussen went missing in Iraq during the first Gulf War. To this day Emmy has reason to hold on to hope that Nick is alive. Her family thinks she's unable to grasp reality and they don't understand the reason behind her optimism.  Two hours every year 11 p.m. to midnight and 9 to 10 a.m. on March 28th were her hours; she would cry her eyes out of she chose.Emmy did glass artwork. When the Castillo Hotel in Las Vegas purchased some of her work, they asked her to spend the winter holidays at the hotel to promote her glass work.  Is the business trip just a fluke or has the wise Madame Eve found a way to  heal Emmy's heart?After 20 years you would think that Emmy would have given up waiting and found a new love.

It goes from female POV to Male POV then a narrator. I was getting confused! Then to me, there's just not enough ""magic."" You can take that as in the bedroom or witch wise, either or, it just isn't there.This series has potential to grow and I know there is a few other books of this out. I'm not sure if the series is complete or not but there is more to it than just this one. Which leads me to say- its not a short story if there's MORE! GRRRR!While I did enjoy the characters themselves, I felt that the story line/plot was a mess. At first it started out very different then just fell flat. Its not that bad to where you don't want to finish it, its just... mundane? Yeah, I'll stick to that.Overall if your looking for insta-love this is it.

B0058O0PXK,A13DHT9IJA4J13,"08 16, 2011",A Book Vacation,A Good Read--But Read the Other Novels in the Series First,"I love the Past Midnight series!  Of course, I went about it all wrong and read the second novel,One Hundred Candles (Harlequin Teen), first.  Yet, I thought it was so good that I went back and read the first novel,Past Midnight (Harlequin Teen)(my favorite so far), and then the short novella,Raising the Dead.  I do love Purnhagen's writing, but I am finding a trend with these novellas.  Although slightly removed from the main storyline and being too short for a complete novel, I've found that I don't care for these novellas as much as I do the actual books in the series.  While these short novellas, especially Haunting the Night, give the reader more insider information pertaining to the characters, I feel like they are a little forced and not as well written as the actual novels.I would love to see Purnhagen flesh out these novellas into full novels, focusing on more details and adding more to the storyline, because there is so much she could do with it all.  However, I also like having these novellas because they give me something to sink my teeth into while I wait for the next novel in the series, so I guess I'm a little torn.Haunting the Night is a great story directly connected to events from One Hundred Candles.  I suggest everyone read it, and the other books in the series, but be forewarned, you do need to read the whole series in order to understand what is happening in Haunting the Night.  Three stars.",3

Try again.","Let me preface this by saying I'm a HUGE fan of Mr. Koontz, whose stories have always kept me on the edge of my seat. I especially love that he breaks all the so-called rules of writing by including a Prologue, using words other than Said in dialogue, and has began a couple of novels with the weather.  Where would bestselling author Madeleine L'Engle be if she had listened to those rules instead of beginning her multiple-award winning classic novel ""A Wrinkle in Time"" in any way other than, ""It was a dark and stormy night""?Back to Odd Interlude #1.....As much as I love all the Odd Thomas tales, I just felt this one was lacking & possibly something done in a rush to keep readers busy between his other novels.  Dean Koontz remains a best selling author for good reason and I hope he doesn't begin resting on his laurels like some former BS authors are doing (Janet Evonovich, for one). There are too many Indie authors on the scene now and these up n coming folks are writing some amazing literature in all genres, including suspense and terror.I kinda felt this was a bait and switch from this terrific author, and when I read that others read it overnight, I wasn't surprised. It was a short story, not a full novel:(  Where the heck was the Elvis sighting?  I'm still upset over that!  Odd Interlude ran out of steam quickly and the end left me pondering whether or not this novella was ghost written.If you are new to the works of Mr. Koontz, I suggest almost any of his former novels, especially Intensity or Tick Tock.Odd Interlude did not put me in a Harmony Corner, but as a mega Koontz fan, I've got to say that I just begun reading Odd Apocalypse and the first chapter has me hooked.",3

The prequel to this was really good.  For that reason I was sure that the sequel would have been better than it was.  The Protector was a very tedious read, it just dragged on too,too much.  The hero was frustrating, stubborn self_pitying and ridiculously blind.  Before I read the 50th page I knew who the culprits causing all the upheaval were.  It was frustrating that the h/ h did not see it.  The heroine was in fog throughout the whole story.  I don't understand why the hero kept her there when he knew her life was at risk.  There are other matters in this story that I considered to be senseless, but I will not comment on them so as not to be too severe in my opinions.

I can't promise a good time, but if history is any indicator, I can promise it'll always be interesting.'""

Character descriptions could have developed more, as well as a deeper explanation on ""The Underlight"" and what it entails. I found the magical and steampunk elements were scarce, which makes it seem like it's not of much importance. The plot could have used some development as well, as the sole plot line seemed to just be rescuing Jolie's kidnapped niece, and although there was her conflict of emotions over Hauk, it just didn't seem enough for me. I think the book could have done real well for me if it was longer and more elaborate.-------First Line: ""Hauk's steambike race down the dark highway, seven of those damn mercenaries from The Hands of Atropos in pursuit and gaining.""

The paranormal part only comes into play in the last few sentences of this offering.  Also like so many others a good bit of the page count is a teaser for the next few chapter offering.The writing is fair and this is intended for a younger audience though not necessarily teen agers.  Lots of references to current trends.  Language and sex are PG.  Author spends a lot of time on main character's self image.I picked it up because it was free and I have been reading widely in this genre, though I am not their target market.  Always an avid reader I started this quest as I was curious about what appears to be a dominant sector of the romance genre.  Having read and enjoyed crossover authors like Lilianna Hart and Stephanie Bond I decided to try the segment of the market they started in. So I started gathering a selection of these from amazon and reading them.  Surprisingly a significant number are good stories that would appeal to many men as well as their female target audience.Now I am left wondering about the serialization trend that seems to be taking over this genre more so than others.  Though I guess if the author is successful it would generate more money per book selling it in bite sized pieces.  However, I wonder what it will mean for the long term success of the authors that have chosen this route.  Or have the correctly gauged the short attention span that seems to be growing in the population and are packaging their works for people that prefer their books in bite sized pieces.Update: In checking this author's website (which I do routinely) she has decided to abandon the serial model and is working toward a complete model.

Yes, it's a historical paranormal, something you don't see very much of lately. So for fans of this genre, Alice's Alpha will be right on target for you!We meet our heroine, Alice, as she's trekking down a mountain a male friend. He dashes off in a hurry, without explanation, leaving her to find her way down alone. As she's starting to feel like she'll never make it to her car again, she stumbles across a cabin and our hero Jed. Jed actually smells her coming before she even gets close to the cabin. He realizes that she is his mate and sets out to seduce her into staying. Of course it's not that easy and they fall into issues along the way.I did really like the character of Alice, which is probably what makes me crave a longer book for them. She isn't the typical female of that time period. She has a job that is traditionally a male job for that time, she's also athletic, and is not afraid to speak her mind and back it up with her actions.As this is a short story, the romance develops very quickly. In some ways too quickly. It was a satisfying read with an HEA, however, the insta-love doesn't leave a lot of relationship development. I think if there had been just a little bit more added, especially with the whole menage aspect it would have made this story more complete. As it was it did leave me hanging in a few spots. The ending IS satisfying though, and they do have a HEA, which makes it quick, light read. Perfect for this time of year.I'd recommend this book for those that like their romance steamy, of course paranormal, and a little bit historical. ~ Reviewed by Chris",3

It was a really good start to a new series I&#8217;m excited about. I love a good, smart, strong heroine and Elle certainly fits the bill.After being betrayed by her long-time boyfriend, a total skeeze named Adam, Elle begins to question everything about her life and the path she thought she was on. Elle begins a journey of self-discovery, both professionally and personally, with the help of sexy, swoony CIA agent Preston Riddick. Along the way, she learns to embrace the life she wants and make the decisions that *she* wants to make, not those that were always assumed by others.Covert Assignment was just a fun book. With an interesting plot filled with suspense, action, betrayal, friendship, romance and a couple seriously sexy scenes, it held my attention. I was sad to see it end. I don&#8217;t read a lot of suspense/action books, but I&#8217;ll make an exception for this series.

The author shows the frame of mind of the person who looks away and does nothing. The guilt, self loathing and anger. At the same time he is feeling almost gleeful about not being targeted.The second storyline features the creation of vampires. The obvious connection in this case is receiving the strength and power to not only subdue, but also being able to act upon those strong thoughts of revenge.I think the chapters leading up to going into the facility could do with some editing. It is drawn out and the event of doing nothing and being a victim are quite similar in structure and contain superfluous details.This is quite on par with a YA book, which is good and I think young people will relate to the story, especially the bullying angle in schools.I received a free copy of this book for my review.",3

B00ID8R1NA,A2JG7WOQRIXW5M,"05 11, 2014",Holly,3 stars!,"I think I'm burned out on zombies/post-apocalyptic novels, because while I found this enjoyable, I didn't necessarily think the undead aspects were all that great. I liked the MC's POV, and I was glad that there was comedic relief throughout. However, all the funny comments took away the sense of desperation and danger. It made the apocalypse seem like some sort of inconvenience and not a real plague.I don't know what it was, but I just couldn't take Donna of the Dead seriously on the whole zombie level. Maybe it was the MC's penchant for cracking jokes in tense situations, or maybe it was because the zombies &#34;roared&#34; all the time. I don't know, but it didn't grip me with a sense of a terror. It wasn't rich with dark and disturbing undertones. If anything, it made me laugh at the complete absurdity to how this apocalypse has turned out.First of all, I really like the MC's POV. Although, as to her and her personality, I waver a bit. Donna is very superficial, sometimes snobbish, and definitely selfish. But she did provide comedic relief throughout, making the apocalypse seem more like a walk in the park than it should be. At the end of the book, though, she did become more likeable to me. Maybe it was because she finally shedded that haughty attitude and uncharacteristic sarcasm to save other people's lives. Maybe it was because she finally understood what it was like to be the heroine of her story, instead of having everybody else come to her rescue. Whatever the case, she did have some growth.Deke, on the other hand, was just pure awesomeness! Heroic, strong, tender, selfless. He was everything that Donna wasn't and everything you want in a male lead. He was always there for Donna, always the first one to volunteer for the most dangerous quests. Him and his bat-wielding skills saved lives, while his kindness and compassion helped soothe those that survived. I loved him so much! But sometimes, I thought he deserved more than Donna and her airheadedness. But, like I said, he was steadfast in his friendship with her all the while wanting more.And that takes me to the &#34;love triangle&#34; between Donna, Liam, and Deke. Boy, I think this love triangle took away my enjoyment from the story. It was just all so very high school and it didn't really make the book light so much as annoying. Donna spent maybe half the book thinking about Liam, describing how utterly perfect he is, that his looks made him seem like a God, and how all she wanted was to talk to him, for him to notice her. She spent half the time wondering about him that she totally missed it on the MOST OBVIOUS CLUES EVER. Or maybe it was just obvious to me.Not to mention, the author made sure to add a character from every single clique from high school. The cheerleaders, the emo/goth kid, the nerds, the jock, the newspaper staff, the wannabe rapper. Every single one of them were so cliche and had very little depth. Honestly, this plot wasn't very deep. It's not to say I didn't like it, but there wasn't much depth to the story-line, and all of the deaths and heartbreak didn't make my heart ache for the characters. I still don't really understand how all of it started, and I still don't get what the voices Donna was hearing mean. It was all speculation at the end, really. And that takes me to the end of the novel--an ending that inspires hope and change to come. It was an easy ending for the book, a safe one.If you're looking for a book that's not going to make you think, that's going to provide with you some light, fluffy fun, then you're in the right place. Donna of the Dead wasn't the best zombie book I've ever read, but it wasn't bad. It was right there between good and please-tell-me-this-isn't-how-people-would-act-in-a-real-apocalypse.",3

That's why I gave it 3 stars.I've just finished the kindle ebook, and it's only because the story is so different and captivating that I managed to get past the translation issues. Several idioms are translated as-is, forcing the reader to guess as what is meant with them.Just one example : ""While they were left clucking their beaks"" ? Okay I guess the writer means that they are still talking, but I'm not totally sure... ? It does make you smile though.Several times I only realised what they meant by what the main character did afterwards. I also felt that a bit more explanation of what happened or how the magic system was used was needed.For example, somewhere in the book there is a mention of the ""armoury curse"" : I could not find a description of what it does only talk between characters. Later on another curse is used, but is it the same ?And what is meant with the Shackles of deliverance curse  and the pump-sign ? More and better explanation please !Probably there is also a different cultural setting, and while in Russia a reader may not need extra information to comprehend the situation, other countries do *not* have the same cultural setting. Why do students were uniforms ? A student cap ? Why are women or girls hardly mentioned or if they are mentioned, why they are treated as only secretaries ""looking for men"" ?This book, correctly translated, could be a real winner.

When Nick see's that Veronica is back home he knows he has to stop by her bakery and see her and hopefully get her out of his system. Nick is never with a woman more than once and Veronica has always intrigued him. Veronica and Nick went to the same school in high school but never hung around the same people. So when Nick stops by Veronica's bakery she is amazed that it's Nick the boy who in high school all the girls wanted. When Nick asks Veronica on a date she happily accepts and Nick hopes that this will finally get her off his mind but it has the opposite effect and Nick and Veronica find themselves spending more and more time together but both are scared of love for good reasons so they will both have to decide if the other is worth the risk and worth moving past their fears. While growing closer and closer someone has a grudge against Nick that they will make sure they repay. This was a pretty good story I felt like at times the story dragged and that the characters internal dialogue was at times wishy washy that being said The writing was good and Karyn Gerrard had me caring about Nick and Veronica easily and rooting for their Happy ever after. I am guessing that book two will be about Veronica's friend and Nick's friend and I like that I have again found a series with different characters for each book.,3

Love is a disease, seen as curable, and anyone who tries to escape the operation which will cure them of ""deliria nervosa"" do not have altered happy endings. I recommend reading DELIRIUM, the first book in the series, before reading any of the novellas which go with the series since more is explained there.The title character is actually the mother of Lena, the narrator of the DELIRIUM novels. Annabel is imprisoned, but that doesn't stop her from remembering the life and love she had before. She describes her memories in vivid detail, which is what I liked the most about this novella. At times I was able to empathize with her when it came to falling in love with her husband (a serious no-no of course).But the reason this novella gets three stars is because, while a nicely written story, there's nothing new to learn if you're already familiar with the world, and if you're new to the storyline, you won't know what's going on. This is such a detriment to fans and potential new readers.And this is a short read. I had hoped it would be lengthy considering the person who is narrating it, but it's quick and the end leaves you asking, ""That's it? Really?"" It felt like there was much more potential and things that should have been added were taken out. This is such a let down. I also don't like to comment on the price of a book due to its length, but this should not be priced at $2.99.If you're able to borrow someone's e-reader and read this novella, I would recommend doing that.",3

Now fate has brought them back together, but if they're really playing for keeps this time, they're going to have to overcome some serious obstacles. They don't trust each other, but the fire of their lust (and apparently love) still burns hot enough to make the devil sweat.I had to take a little while to think about this book after I finished it, because I didn't know how to rate and review it. Here's a breakdown of what I've decided:The sex was pretty good (not amazing, but not boring), but for a supposedly BDSM story, there was very little actual BDSM. There was some power exchange, a little restraining and spanking, but that was just about it. Or at least that's all I remember.Daly and Copeland annoyed me horribly. I wanted to bash their heads together several times and scream at them both to grow up, get over the past, and stop acting so childish. Copeland wasn't as bad as Daly, though. She was infuriating at times. Copeland didn't annoy me like that until near the end, I think, at which point all I could do was put my Kindle down and say, &#34;Oh no he didn't!&#34; (along with some more &#34;colorful&#34; expletives following that sentiment).I just couldn't bring myself to like and really care about Jeremiah and Daly, and found myself more interested in some of the other characters (like Candace, Toby, and Ruthie)The writing wasn't bad, but there were things that bothered me. Copeland and Daly &#34;growled&#34; a lot, or &#34;bit out&#34; words. A few more descriptive terms would have helped. Also, the overuse of single word sentences to emphasize a statement became distracting after a while (&#34;Tell. Me.&#34; was used more than once, for example, as well as &#34;To. Me.&#34;)I wanted to love this book, but I'm having a hard time even liking it right now. To be fair, I'm in an odd reading mood and I can see that, so I'm rating it based on a system that helped me look at the story rationally. Overall, it was good and I might recommend it to someone who enjoys drama, light BDSM, and a little mystery tied in with their erotica.I received a free copy of this for review from NetGalley",3
B004Z2I6HS,AK0CENM3LUM28,"08 5, 2011",Amazon Customer,"An interesting short story, but difficult to sink into","Survivors / 9781459207769This is an interesting short story -- only about 30 pages long on my reader -- but it's one of those stories where I felt the whole time that there was another book before the story that I needed to read in order to sink into this one. I notice that the author has a trilogy set in this world (Aftertime,Rebirth, and Horizon), so I almost wonder if it wouldn't be better to read one or more of those first.""Survivors"" is a zombie apocalypse novella, which I usually enjoy, but the zombies aren't really a major presence in this book. Instead, the focus is on the survivors and how they've pieced together a world inside a walled community called ""The Box"" in the aftermath of the apocalypse. This contributed in some ways to the disorientation I felt as a reader, because there seemed to be a lot of information dispensed as obvious-to-the-author that was nevertheless confusing to me.For instance, a major point of the novella is that children aren't allowed in The Box because it's 'no place for children', so when a young survivor is brought in from a raid, everyone has to decide what to do with him. The problem for me was that I didn't see why, say, drug addictions and prostitution would make ""The Box"" inhospitable for children, as compared to, say, the slavering zombie apocalypse outside. Then, too, the mentality seems a little limiting: I guess the denizens of The Box are intending to live hard and die young all at the same time? If the situation was set up more like, say, a cult it might make more sense, but since everyone is presented as a relatively normal person dealing with the harsh realities of the world, this ""no children, no procreation"" rule just seems a little inhuman. (Not to mention impossible to achieve, unless all the prostitutes of The Box have high-priority raids on pharmacies for birth control pills.)The writing for this novella isn't the best I've ever read -- there are a lot of long and sometimes convoluted sentences that can be a little confusing. Some of the punctuation could also be edited a bit, as there is an over-reliance on commas that I sympathize with but which is nevertheless distracting to read. Still, all told, this is an interesting novella and you can't beat the current free price on Amazon. For myself, I think I'll watch the Kindle sales and ifAftertimecomes on sale, I'll pick it up and start the series over with that book.~ Ana Mardoll",3

B00BSG0LF4,A2RCSX9SIMIK67,"06 14, 2013",Amazon Customer,Ghost Station - maybe....,"The Wandering Engineer series has been fun so far and yes, I got my money's worth with Ghost Station and will be following the storyline further... for the moment.The ""for the moment"" comment however, should be a warning to any author from his readers. The universe of the Wandering Engineer is great, the tec is well thought out, the backstory interesting, and the principal characters - Irons, Sprite, Defender and Proteus are engaging, well drawn and interesting. You root for Irons to succeed and the story draws you in.That said however, in this book the author becomes his own worst enemy. Unlike previous books in the series, in Ghost Station there are endless references to modern, popular culture, TV programs and politics. They are meant to be tongue in cheek and witty, but they aren't.  One jibe yes. Two, hmmm. Three? Four? Five? Six.. Seven etc. The references intrude in to the story again and again, detracting from the storyline and ruining the suspension of disbelief.Ghost Station has an interesting tale to tell but it's all too frequently interrupted by farce, farce that doesn't suit the tone or the balance of the book. Good jokes, wrong book.Readers should be aware of two other faults with Ghost Station, one simply bad, the other yet another' maybe' problem for the author.Number one: Tense. Poor editing from the midpoint of the book onwards means sentences ""Bill likes salt so Bill asks  for salt and Sarah passes it."" start to crop up. These editing misses aren't fatal, but leaving skeleton work like this in an otherwise well written story breaks pace and becomes steadily more annoying. This is an editing only issue however and one the author can easily fix in future works.Number two however is a potential story killer - and possibly a career killer for the author. The author presents an unrelentingly ill-informed view of both politics and politicians. Nothing as foolishly dirty as the politicians in this series can survive more than a book or two without turning readers off not just at the politicians, but at the shear implausibility of such repeatedly stupid behaviour... and not just by the politicians but by Irons, the central character.The series has used the same mechanism twice now to resolve its story line. The first time - Ok. Different, a bit of a stretch but it worked and presented a legitimate and well thought out end to the story. But twice? Any more such uses will destroy the credibility of what is a genuinely interesting and engaging series. Once was interesting, twice.. not so much. Three.. well it will be time to go read something else. People who actually work with politicians know that most genuinely try to do a good job and do try to look at the big picture. To encounter truly stupid and evil politicians as a group  once was Ok, But twice? And just how stupid does the author think the average citizen really is? In Ghost Station they seem almost completely clueless and fickle despite hat Irons has done for them. As I say, once was legitimate in the series, but twice? No. So Ghost Station overall? I'd give both Ghost Station and this series five stars for the main characters, storyline and universe; but in the end the errors above downgrade it to a three. The author needs to concentrate on his knitting more. He's got talent and a story to tell - more story and talent than most military SF writers out there at the moment - but a broader, less remorselessly cynical approach is needed to show he truly understands how the world and people work. So yes, I'd recommend this book to my friends, but the yes it also has its faults. But a very, cool universe and main character...",3

And it did cause me to need to know how this one ends. Therefore I couldn't put it down. But the whole time I was wanting not only more of Adam's POV, but an in depth look into him period. Which I did not get.The book starts off with how Adam comes to be. Then we hear Adam's voice, his thoughts, & see his actions. Which are beyond frightening & dark. Then it shifts to our heroine, Ellory But she takes up majority of the book with her POV. Which was too much, too long, and way less interesting. Unfortunately this continues till the end. You get snippets here & there of Adam but not nearly as much. So you get a huge shift in the story but it's very unbalanced. So much so that you often wonder ""Ok, why am I reading so much about this girl's teenage angst, when I really need to be reading about Adam?""And then of course this books ends with a HUGE & very confusing cliffhanger. It was so abrupt & jumbled, that it leaves you with the impression that the author just decided to stop writing.This one wanted to come across as dark, sinister, & twisted but sadly it loses that mark once you're introduced to the heroine. And it never gets back on it's path.Hopefully things will be more balanced, clear & take on the tone it was trying to take here, in book 2.But I strongly advise if you pick this book up, make sure you have book 2 as well.

B00ATNX1SG,A2KBZ0LCH3MSF9,"05 9, 2013",Sheri Boston,A tale of what if...,"I received this book from the author in exchanged for an honest review :)The thought of reading a story of parallel lives was very interesting to me. To see the effects of a possible chance meeting between two people and how it determines their lives from that point on. I was worried it could get a bit complicated and confusing but the worry was unwarranted. Matthew Turner lays it out for you very simply. The passages in which they've met start out having the title ""With..."" and so obviously when they haven't it's ""Without..."" Simple.I'll probably touch on this subject a few times during this review because without it there's really nothing that can be done to change your mind one way or the other. Hope. In order for a romance to take hold of you and keep you endlessly turning the pages to reach those last few lines you must have hope. Hope that even in the darkest times of this love, that eventually it will get better. I was...without.Part of the issue was the characters. Honestly I just didn't like them. And I tried. Believe me when I say I did. Because I wanted nothing more than to love this book. But both Clark and Bella were very weak and selfish people. Especially Bella. There's nothing wrong with weak. But they needed to grow, become more than what they were at the start. I just didn't see that until maybe towards the end? But even then they were questioning. Always questioning.Everyone was just so...sad and depressing. On one side they were just settling and becoming miserable people. They'd settle for just enough to be, moderately satisfied. Stifling dreams and hopes and fears and inwardly letting it all eat away at them into this miserable existence. It's so sad to read. I was never fully given any hope for either of them. Once just the slightest bit was brought in it was quickly dashed away with the contrary internal conflicts. On the other side they poured themselves into their dreams. Which is fine. But at the cost of friends and family? At the cost of everything? I felt no happiness on either sides of the parallel. Just frustration and deep sadness.Clark is supposed to be this guy who avoids love. And yet in both paths of his life you never really see that, whether it was with Bella or Beki he was into the relationship, even his friend Sam would remark about how different and changed he was. It wasn't until he makes a very important relationship decision when he's with Bella, that is HIS choice, no hinting from her not even a spark of inspiration to make this decision. Once he's done it, it's like he snaps and all of a sudden he questions everything he's doing and wants to bolt most of the time. It just didn't make sense to me. Had he shown signs of this from the beginning maybe it wouldn't have been such a big deal. But there was just too much contradiction within each path.I liked one person from the start of the book, Alex, and by a little over the halfway mark the signs I saw coming from him had me lose faith completely. And I was right. It broke my heart. By that point I had given up entirely and was just drifting through. I felt nothing. Because I should have had hope. Even if it's just a sliver. I need to be able to feel like by the time I get to the end of this story something will make me say, ""oh yes. This was worth it.""There was one bright gem. One part that had me absolutely laughing out loud. It was just so random and funny. All of a sudden in the middle of it all we have this brief passage, a conversation between Clark and his best friend Sam...about a whale...and swimming. I'm telling you it's random as all hell and killed me. I wanted more like that. I think had there been more glimpses of funny, no matter how brief, I'd be singing a different tune.I give Matthew Turner credit for the fact that this whole idea was exciting and thought provoking. The whole ""what if"" thing. And the effort was made and attempted, the book really tried. It just wasn't enough for me.",3

It's particularly gratifying that the Hero and Heroine are intelligent and don't dither in the land of ""misunderstanding.""  Their personal self doubts are realistically portrayed and resolved in a reasonable amount of time.A more astute author would expand a bit upon some of the secondary characters or show more scenes of the Hero and Heroine's interacting, rather than describing their interactions.  The massive house and the grounds are not given much to do, and usually a book set in a creepy old house has a few more excitements for the reader.  Also, it seems a bit unrealistic that the Heroine could be left quite so destitute after her parents die -- surely an only female child would be provided for in any standard will?The villain of the piece is given no real psychological underpinning for his/her behavior.  So, again, you can just enjoy this book on a rainy day for its modest accomplishments and resounding happy ending.  You actually do believe the couple will have an interesting and satisfying marriage.  And that's sometimes enough for a romance!",3

Olivia has left her entire life behind in search of some names on a list with Marcus, Passion and the PSS kids.  She is going to go undercover into a private school with Passion in hopes of recruiting a girl from the list into their group.  Sounds like a simple enough plan but it turns out that it might not be that easy as Samantha James is the daughter of the leader of a cult.  Not just any cult either, one that worships PSS.I enjoyed the fast paced story line that followed.  While a few of my questions were answered (not a lot of them but a few) there were so many more posed.  Now not only are there CAMFers that hunt PSS kids there is a semi-religious group called The Hold also looking for kids with PSS to join their ranks.  At times there was so much going on I got a little muddled.  I did however love the expansion of Passion and Jason&#8217;s characters.  Passion who was such a mystery at the beginning of the book was shed in a completely different light and I liked her transition in the story.  It was great to see Passion and Olivia become friends and find some common ground.  Jason really grew up a little in this book and instead of just being a gun toting conspiracy theorist he really started to grow on me as someone who sees what is going on and is always watching out for the people he cares about.I had a few small issues with the book.  One is all the coincidences.  I didn&#8217;t completely buy into them.  I can&#8217;t remember the exact number but I think that there were like four or five things that just happened to happen and to be a coincidence.  The other was I was foggy on a few details/names from the previous book and most authors I will complain over explain things to jog your memory.  I think this is the only book I will say the opposite.  Had I read Ghost Hand right before this that wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem but I read it six months ago so I forgot a few names and while Ripley did get to who they were in the story it seemed they had been mentioned a few times before she jogged my memory.  The last thing was I really wanted Olivia to pull stuff out of people.  That was the most interesting part of the first book to me.  I loved how the things Olivia took out of people changed them, possibly made them better and I&#8217;m fascinated by it.  But she was afraid of herself and her gift in this book.  I really wish I could have read more about that aspect of the story.A few of the brighter points from this book:  I don&#8217;t know what to think about Marcus I flip back and forth between he is a good guy trying to protect everyone in his group to he has something bigger he is hiding and maybe he is the worst villain of all.  The mystery surrounding both Marcus&#8217;s past and Olivia&#8217;s parents added a new layer to storyline.  The last five chapters were incredibly intense and the cliffhanger at the end was unbelievably jagged, it cut me.I enjoyed the first book in the series a little more but overall the addition to the storyline kept me engaged and I will definitely be interested to see what happens in the final book of the series.",3

Both generations deal with natural disasters as well as man made ones.This story seemed kinda blah at times, and I would have loved a little more on when Cammie and Noah were teens. Also, Noah says Cammie's grandmother &#34;took him in&#34;....but that makes no sense as his family lived within 50 miles, loves him, and are fairly well off, so he's not a drifter.

Sex and the reason why she she needs to end it or confront him about cheating or lying or ""be done"" is her ONLY dialogue in this entire series.  At least Nathan progresses somewhat  in this book.  The ending was too quick, no real development or growth in their relationship...it is let me explain about the suite, let me explain about the cell phone, let me explain about the bet....good now that you understand let's get married.

If he was that disgusted with Drew and he already stated that after the bet he told Drew to F/O and get lost...then why was he sitting there saying what he said and sounding the way he said it...I HAVE to be on Jessica's side for that.  I get why the author added that, for the suspense but it wasn't a good idea.  It made Nathan not only look really REALLY bad, but it just didn't make any sense for him to say those things.

The writing seemed forced and more than a little over the top in introducing the two very immature MCs, both US Marshals, working for Sam Kage (from ""A Matter of Time"" series) who drove me crazy. Miro, after over three years on the job, persists in wearing expensive, designer clothes to work but then whines and cries when he ruins them while apprehending fugitives and less than cooperative witnesses. And he lusts, big time, over his partner, Ian, with the mind-numbing intensity of a testosterone-laden teenager. Ian, an ex-Green Beret is a real oaf - both on the job where he refuses to follow most, if not all, enforcement procedures as well as in his personal life as he spends his entire time on dates calling Miro, whining and crying about how bored and unhappy he is and wanting to be with Miro. (And Ian is supposed to be the straight guy!) And as for being professional partners - they sure spend a lot of time touching each other and being in the other's space. I hope all US Marshals do not conduct themselves in the same way. I didn't like either of them for the longest time and almost gave up reading. Heck, at this point, I didn't even like the characterization of Sam Kage - and I love Sam Kage!I did however, finish the book but it was a rather formulamatic, Mary Calmes story and the ending of the book did nothing to erase my initial dislike of the MCs.2.5 rating rounded up to 3.",3

He has been placed on leave, indefinitely,(or sacked) due to his propensity to shoot first, ask questions later. Nearing age 50, Ben doesn't know what to do with himself now. He and his wife do not get along and he feels at odds since losing his job. Getting drunk one night, he e-mails a movie star, Brenda Grant, to whom he relates how amazing he believes her to be, about his wife(who hates him), and how he got sacked over shooting people. Unknown to Ben and contrary to what he and most people thought about stars and their fan mail, Brenda had read Ben's e-mail. Realizing that he is in a rut, Ben looked up his old mentor, Akira Misaki, who helps him get back in shape and back in touch with his martial arts skills. When Ben signs on with a private security agency and winds up in Port Douglas, the last person that he expects to see is his idol, Brenda Grant, who is there on movie location.  While there he gets involved with Joy McKay whose husband has been missing several months. Joy doesn't feel like the police are doing anything to find her husband and on top of that she is now being threatened so Ben steps in to help.

B008GT83FG,A1BTMCNAQ97FRQ,"07 18, 2012",Brian Beam,Not up to par,"Alright, maybe Terry Goodkind just set the bar way too high for himself with his earlier books, but I honestly felt like it was a bit of a chore to make it through the First Confessor.  Obviously, I read it through to the end, so there had to be some kind of satisfying substance to keep me going, but overall, I am disappointed in this book.The story is fairly interesting, and it is nice to have some back story to accompany Goodkind's Sword of Truth Series.  In this book, we learn about the origins of the Sword of Truth, Confessors, as well as get some reveals about other aspects of the SOT universe(which I won't go into for spoiler reasons).  Characters we have heard so much about in later books such as Magda, Baraccus, and Merritt are the focus in this book.However, one thing I can not get past in this book is the ridiculous amount of wordy dialogue that 1)repeats itself several times over, 2)treats readers like they're idiots by over explaining every last detail, and 3)is about as unrealistic as humanly possible.  I mean, conversations spanning 5-6 chapters... Plus, in Goodkinds prior books, each main character had a certain personality that reflected in the way they spoke or their mannerisms.  The characters here are a bit flat.  There were honestly bits of dialogue without dialogue tags that I  forgot who was even speaking.I am still a Terry Goodkind fan, and I will continue to read his work, if nothing else than for the great times I had with his earlier works.  However, with this and Omen Machine, I can't help but feel that the level of care, love, and attention that he used to put into this world has been replaced with a desire to rush out a few books for some quick cash.

Having not read book one, I can say that this can be enjoyed very well as a stand alone, although it ends with a strong urging to read book three!  I loved Kessler's description of the Yucatan jungle.  Not sure if it was accurate, but she made it come to life. The sounds, the smell, the heavy air, and the atmosphere that just gets creepy as the Night Demon begins to escape her prison.Lukas and Gretchen are perfect for each other from page one.  Lukas just need to figure that out for himself and come to grips with the type of creature he is.  Meeting the ancient night walkers, the gods of the North, South, East, and West, may help but he needs to make sure Gretchen survives the Night Demons hunger first.Night Demon includes a little bit of everything with a heavy dose of romance to tie it together.  There is a mystery, mistaken identity, intrigue, betrayal, an epic fight scene.  The only down side, and what prevented the 4th star, was that at times there was just a little too much going on for me.

He keeps Angeline with him as he searches for Claire, whom Angeline protects with her silence.As with other books I have read by Blake, the happenings seem authentic to the time period, when women had a different value than men and the wilderness was filled with outlaws.  Blake does a superb job of developing characters, storylines and suspense.  She almost held off the conclusion too long on this one, though.  I was about to give up on the HEA, creating happy endings in my mind,  resorting to ending ""B"", when it finally came.  Whew!!Book 2: Royal Passion.

To free her grandmother from gambling debt incurred there, Mara is forced into seducing Angeline and Rolfe' s son, Prince  Roderick.

Well you might be surprised...Some thoughts on &#34;Counterfeit Youth&#34;...1.) generally well written and edited.2.) an interesting story premise.3.) a definitive ending.The Cons:1.) characters that I didn't particularly connect with or feel any sense of empathy towards.2.) character dialogue/thoughts seemed a bit forced and contrived.3.) a time-line that seemed to jump around quite a bit along with the abrupt change of locales. All at the expense of character development.Impressions:An intriguing sci-fi short story that held some promise. However the rather unaspiring characters and their weak dialogue left this story somewhat less than it might have been.One of those books whose brevity, adversely affected the overall quality of the tale being told.As it is... 3 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholsonraynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com@ralannicholson",3

B00AV0K608,A2DLQZRMYHP3BL,"05 6, 2013",Pamerd,Wonderful historical romance,"The Cuvier Widows is a trilogy that has been recently re-released into a box set with nice new covers. The overall arc of the story is about three women who recently found out they were married to the same man at the same time. Marian, Nicole and Layla had no idea about each other until they are summoned to the hotel room where he died. Even the police are stunned when three different women claim to be Jean Cuvier's wife. I love the concept and the story is very interesting as we track each widow through the months after Jean dies. Jean leaves a trail of tears as we see what type of man he was, how he treated his children, wives and business partners, he was an evil person that left many unhappy people in his wake.As the will is read all three realize that only Marian is the true wife and will inherit it all with both Nicole and Layla getting nothing, however they will all have to live with the scandal of being married to a bigamist.Wronged:Marian Cuvier was married to Jean for twelve years and they have two children. At one time she was in love with him however as the years passed and he was rarely home and took several mistresses she began to hate him. She believes she can finally be free of this loveless marriage when she finds out he died.Louis Fournet was Jean's business partner and is hoping he will be able to now sell the business and move on with his plan to work with his family. However when he talks to Marian she tells him that she wants to keep the business for her son and learn to run it.As Louis teaches Marian about the business there is a growing attraction between them however they are both keeping secrets and telling lies and there is little trust in the relationship.Betrayed:Nicole Curvier was married to Jean for four years and is currently pregnant with their first child. Now she is worried that her child will have the stigma of illegitimacy for the rest of his life. Nicole's mother never married her father, so she knows what will happen and how they will be treated. She is looking for a husband in name only and finds the perfect person in a drifter who comes to help. Nicole's name is still on the deed for the plantation Jean bought so she is lucky that even through there is scandal; she will have a place of her own.Maxim Viel has been watching Nicole trying to find information about the plantation his family used to own, he wants to get it back for them. So he pretends to be a drifter without any money and will be happy to marry Nicole and give her his name.As they work the plantation, they become close however with lies and secrets between them neither know what is going on and there is no trust. When tragedy strikes, Nicole and Max must learn to wade through the lies to trust and love.Beguiled:Layla Curvier was married for only a year and she hated her husband, she was forced to marry him when her father sold him their shipping business. She is very happy to be rid of Jean and was about to leave him when she found him dead in the hotel room. She is the last one to have seen him and the prime suspect of the murder. Her childhood friend, Drew Soulier wants to help her and will use his skills as a lawyer to represent her during her trial.Drew has a specific reason for representing Layla, he knows this will gain a lot of publicity and wants to be mayor. With all the evidence they have gathered, even Drew does not believe her innocence.Layla believes there is another woman who may have been involved with Jean and she is determined to find information about her. She must find something to show she is innocent and in the meantime she and Drew get close. However the fact that he does not believe her and he is not telling her everything, she has a hard time trusting him.When the trial begins, she must put her faith in Drew and others as her life depends on it.The concept of the trilogy was great, I love that the three widows were shocked when they found out what Jean did and must make their own way for their immediate future. The year was 1895 and although it was quite modern in many aspects, still the papers were alive with all the gossip and scandal. I liked all the women in the stories, Marian was very strong and willing to take the reins of the business, Nicole was willing to marry a man she did not know to give her baby something she never had and Layla was determined to prove her innocence even though those around her did not believe her. The fault I found is with the men and all the lies, secrets and downright manipulation they did to get what they wanted. I had a hard time liking any of them. Louis did not believe Marian could run a business so never told her anything that was going on, even when a strike was looming. Max never told Nicole about his family and that they use to own the plantation she lived on so she believed he was a poor drifter until late in the book. Drew only wanted to use Layla for publicity, only when she finds evidence to help does he look at her differently.The stories all were interesting and I enjoyed the time period, the turn of the century, where people had more choices in life, the world was changing and I enjoyed the semi-freedom women started to have. The books were fast paced I was glad I was able to read them all at the same time as they flowed well together since they all took place at the same time. All in all they were enjoyable books - I just wanted the women to live on their own without the men they selected in their lives.I give The Cuvier Widows by Sylvia McDaniel 3.25 stars!Review also posted at Ramblings from a Chaotic Mind",3

Any child with a love of science fictionand space will enjoy this book, at times it can seem a little stilted and perhaps some more editorial time would have really made this good book great.Managing to combine personal relationships with a good old fashioned adventure and a bit 'world saving' or 'universe saving', Cory is thrust into a world of terrorists, bombs and threats when he accompanies his father and new, rather interesting step-mother to the Midway Space Station, where his father works, of course all does not go to plan, and it is up to Cory to try and save the day.Either as a read alone for an older child, or as a read aloud, this book offers a rich world of science fiction adventure and trepidation.  The author has specifically written the book so that adults will also enjoy the story whilst reading to their children and she has achieved this, within the book there is enough adult sub text for a parent reading to enjoy the time reading aloud.KatieRazberry Juice",3
B005CWGOS8,A37J3XRX1TENTS,"09 7, 2011",S. Richards,Mind over matter,"As with most of Scribner's work, this collection of short stories is well-written, and the stories included are The Chair, Emotional Transference, and The Dichotic. For me, none of the stories have a dark feeling to them, nor do they have a hard jab to the ending. Instead, each story presents an interesting take on how the mind works, consciously and subconsciously, leaving the reader thinking about how exactly mental energy is expended, collected or exchanged, and how mood and thought are influenced by the power of suggestion and other outside stimuli.It's interesting what Scribner came up with here. Not horror, these stories are more just some odd or strange situations to think about.

B00CJV6N0Y,A1WRXACOKPITBQ,"07 2, 2013","Leiah ""So, I Read This Book Today . . .""",Wasted potential,"Artful Dodger - Nageeba Davis - 3 starsA Kindle ""Freebie""While other readers apparently really loved this book, I must confess to a somewhat less ebullient attitude toward the book. As with many other reviewers, I would greatly wish for a half-star in order to give the book 3  stars, but as that is not the case, I must sadly drop a full star. Once I state my case, you will either agree or disagree. As always, everyone's tastes are different.What I liked about the book is the mystery itself. Well written and smart, the mystery itself, involving the murder of the main character's neighbor and close friend, was plotted meticulously and was highly believable.  The denouement itself was heart-rending, and, had the book been based solely upon the mystery itself, would have been a five-star read.The crippling aspect of the book, to me, was the character development. For all that I desperately wanted to like the main character and the relationships in the book, I simply couldn't. Don't get me wrong - many aspects of Maggie were admirable. She is strong and funny in many ways. However, her anger and attitude were over-the-top for a woman with her background. OK, maybe women all have `daddy issues'. However, Maggie's issues wind up forcing me to see her as a spoiled, self-centered mess with very few truly good characteristics other than an admittedly hard-fought love for her neighbor. Honestly, I would have loved for her neighbor to have hung around and someone else to have been killed - Elizabeth is one feisty, fascinating character I would have loved to have followed.As for the love interest, Villari, he is well written to a point, but his immediate attraction to this character is somewhat unbelievable given the way the heroine is written. Maggie is angry and aggressive, and seems to glory in the fact that she is a total psychological mess who, while dreaming of being an accomplished artist, can't be bothered to finish anything she starts. Add in her inability to show even a modicum of care for her own well being (the whole eating the green lunchmeat thing because you can't be bothered to occasionally drop by the market just turned my stomach) and the idea of a well-pulled-together male lead falling for her is beyond believable. As much as we all might long for the hunky hero to fall for the plain-Jane, this one was just a little too over-the-top unbelievable to me.Overall, I wanted to love the book a lot more than I did. I originally started the book as a light read between much deeper, more powerful books that I am doing for the authors as R4R. It had great potential, but in the end Maggie herself drug the whole book down until I simply finished it to find out `who-dun'-it'. At least I wasn't disappointed by that particular outcome.",3

Even though it was sort of frustrating in the end when we realize that Lainey is still hiding somethings, and Kade could sort of go nuts.. Makes me wonder if there will be another book and really bad things will happen... Anyways, I liked the story. And I liked Lainey for the most part. She was a pretty awesome character. She was able to control her emotions, and I loved how she stood up to Kade even though most others wouldn't. But Kade I didn't really care for. I sort of felt like he was kind of whiny. But then I felt really bad for the things he has been through so that made me understand a little bit. So over all I liked the book.

Mild spoilers may be contained within this review.Wow, what to say about this book. Like most books that I read, I skipped over the synopsis. Call me lazy, or forgetful, but I usually like to jump into books not knowing a lot about them. I usually read the title and the genre, but other than that, I leave it up to fate. I like to jump into things not knowing where they&#8217;re going. Sometimes I end up pleasantly surprised, and sometimes I end up going &#8220;oh&#8230; that&#8217;s what this is&#8230;&#8221; Unfortunately, this was a bit of the latter.At it&#8217;s heart, Before Midnight is a retelling of the Cinderella story. That isn&#8217;t bad in and of itself&#8212;I think given some care, retellings can be almost better than the original story as long as the author puts some effort into really expanding upon the core idea. This story wasn&#8217;t like that. Yes, there were a few things changed&#8212;for instance: the prince is a lycanthrope&#8230; in fact, the entire royal family is. Also, the Cinderella of this story, Loupe, is a loup garou (bitten werewolf vs. born a werewolf like the prince). That certainly promises to make the story a bit of a different telling &#8211; and it did&#8230; to an extent.The main problem I had with the story itself is that it was predictable. It didn&#8217;t take more than the first three chapters to realize that this story was a retelling &#8211; and hence, I already knew the ending. There weren&#8217;t any plot twists or turns to surprise me, and I instantly knew everything was going to turn out all right. That&#8217;s how fairytales end. To be honest, it would have been nice to see this end tragically, or at the very least have a bit more tension built in. There were some instances that I thought were going to lead to conflict (Like Loupe and her family being poachers and skinning wolves left and right) that quickly fizzled out and in the end, didn&#8217;t make much of a difference.  The evil characters were Evil with a capital E, and the good characters were Good with a capital G. There was no gray area.The narrative itself jumped around a little bit. Going into the story, my first impression of the narrative is that it was slow and dry. The Introduction was verbose and filled with needless detail about each character it introduced and every movement they took. It dragged. Then in the middle of the story, once it got into the romance between Prince Etienne and Loupe, the language turned very&#8230; blunt and modern. I wasn&#8217;t sure what time period the story was set in (and I wasn&#8217;t given a lot of clues) but it seemed odd to have the prince say things like &#8220;tell me you jest&#8221; and then in the same chapter have him drop the F-bomb.Not only did the narrative move around a lot, but so did the mythology; including things such as the world-tree, but also the fey, vampires, werewolves (two types, from two different mythologies), demons, angels, dryads and berserkers&#8230; It&#8217;s not bad to have a mixed mythology like this &#8211; in fact, usually it&#8217;s quite entertaining, but again, it made it hard to figure out where this story fell in it&#8217;s world building. I think I would have preferred a more stringent set of rules to adhere to. It would have at least been nice to know what part of the world the story was taking place in, or the time period&#8212;neither of which I was privy to.The characters themselves weren&#8217;t bad. I liked Etienne (even if he was a bit moronic by his lack of realizing Loupe was a loup garou&#8230;), and Loupe was&#8230; pleasant despite her weak character. I only wish the author hadn&#8217;t softened the blow of Loupe&#8217;s big kick-ass moment by basically telling us what was going to happen with a short backstory about an ancestor. It really stole her thunder. My biggest complaint about any of the characters was Loupe&#8217;s name. Why on earth would an author name the main character after her own species..? A species, I might add, that the prince spends the entirety of the book looking for? It was so obvious that I literally face palmed. It made the prince seem stupid, and it made me angry, because I felt as if, as a reader, I was being treated as moronic as well.In the end, I felt as if the reader was being treated like a child for most of the story. The impacts were softened for me, the tension was pushed aside, the events were obvious before hand&#8230;honestly, it was a bit frustrating. So why did I give it three stars? Because despite all of this, the book wasn&#8217;t bad. It was a quick afternoon read, I was entertained, and the writing itself was clear and grammatically correct (minus one missing word I found). I liked it. It wasn&#8217;t great, but it wasn&#8217;t horrendous either. It was, and I hesitate to say this, cute. Would I recommend it to a friend? Yes, if they&#8217;re a fan of werewolves and the story of Cinderella. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d push it on to any hardcore paranormal romance readers though. It certainly wasn&#8217;t genre breaking or fascinating, but it was okay.",3

In any case, the plot kept what the blurb promised: there was a love story and there was a suspense part. I know that many suspense romance readers won't agree with my approach to separate those from each other.  Basically I agree and believe me, it's the first time I do that when reviewing. However, in this case this was necessary, especially when taking into consideration that these two parts did neither blend with each other nor complement each other to create a smooth and rewarding outcome.The romance between Libby and Mark was OK - nothing special like in Adam's and Kelsey's case (previous installment of the series), which definitely set the standard against which I'm going to judge any further installment of the series. Libby was depicted as a young and inexperienced woman, a fact which was clearly reflected in her behavior and attitude, which sometimes gave me a really hard time.  Mark had more life experience, his bearing and mannerism more mature. However, I was very disappointed to discover that both of them were sexually inexperienced and that they advocated against premarital sex.  Nothing against this point of view but I just thought that this idea didn't round off the romance part. Maybe because this thread wasn't harmonically enough presented and seemed therefore out of context?I appreciated the glimpse into Adam's and Kelsey's life. It was also very interesting to see that Mark had his difficulties with Adam's ""management style"". These ""boss - employee difficulties"" let the heroes appear very real life and I considered this a very nice touch.Now the suspense part of the book was very disappointing. I considered this part of the plot not plausible. I know, this is a book of fiction and therefore there is no need to be realistic.  True. However, no matter how (un)realistic the storyline, it has to  be elaborated properly, the result or general impression has to be harmonic. I didn't think this was the case in this book and was therefore really disappointed when I closed the book.",3

The book is well written and has a stream do consciousness feel to it, but it is not a particularly pleasant easy, read. It is rather challenging, requiring that we suspend reality and immerse ourselves in a world that continues to elude us. I can't say that I loved the book. I can't say that I hated the book. What I can say is that it was an elusive and challenging read that requires a commitment to finish it. The use of language is lovely but the book left me wondering, ""Now what was that really all about?""",3

Burney Sheridan (known as Burn) is a vampire who is temporarily posing as a cover model but never expects that his true mate Deanna Brooks (Dean) will appear at one of the author's signing sessions for the books that he appears on. Unfortunately, the path to true love requires that each partner accepts the other unconditionally and that is not necessarily the case here even though they are extremely compatible in the bedroom. The premise is good and the vampire's sexy Irish lilt is alluring but the characters were a bit two-dimensional and the resolution abrupt and unsatisfying for me. I was disconcerted by the female character's nickname and I thought the vampire's name a bit ironic considering that other vampire lore I have read indicates that fire is something to be avoided. I think that the limitations of the brevity of this story handicap the development of the plot which has great potential and I hope that the characters are revisited in a longer incarnation.

Sure, it's a little depressing dealing with relics of failed relationships each day, but Rose is determined not to let it break her `love conquers all' spirit. After discovering the museum's handsome curator is nursing a broken heart of his own, Rose steps in to fix it. But does every relationship truly deserve a second chance?If you're looking to read something short and sweet with feel good factor and a subtle dose of karma, then look no further than this offering by Talli Roland.The story centers around Rose Delaney, a romantic at heart, who has taken a job at a quirky new museum, The Museum of Broken Hearts,  a place that will exhibit important items that once belonged to people who, yes, have been left with a broken heart.Rose falls for the handsome curator, Heath, who is also nursing a broken heart, but not for another woman...his heart was broken by his mother.Rose, again the romantic at heart sets out to resolve Heath's relationship with his mother.  Working at the museum slowly allows Rose to realize that some relationships just aren't worth saving.  The question is...is her own relationships one to save or let go.I was expecting a longer book but the author did what she intended to do which was to show the reader that happy endings are always possible, but you just can't write them like a romance novel.  They just have to happen on their own.  Also the concept of a Museum of Broken Hearts was a brilliant idea which allowed Roland to tell her story as quickly as she did.

B00BND1UTS,AJKQE92ZKWBAO,"05 2, 2013",Dee,"Ward of the vampire, 3.5 stars, short glimpse of a novel or series?","I'm one of the few ones to rate this lower as 3.5 stars.  This is my first book by this author.  Told in first person, it is a fairly short story (50 pages) of a posh birthday party for the brother of the boss of our main character, Lina, and the events leading up to & the end of the party.  It is basically setting up series or book to follow.  Obviously the boss & said brother are vampires and there is a history there. I won't go into what is already described.  The premise was good but there was lack of description of what the lead female, Lina, looked like. There was vague references to her as being curvy  but nothing about her height, color of her skin, hair or eyes.  I had a hard time capturing the essence of who Lina was except by what she told us in her inner dialogue which didn't help me ""get"" her at all. These small details help in a short story so the imagination can take it from there. It took away the immersion into the story for me. The interior of the homes were described better than she was!  As for the male lead, I didn't get a real sense of who he was because of what happened but I was intrigued just the same.  If I had those details, I would have enjoyed this more but it felt kind of lacking (perhaps this would be updated by the time it's read by others).The story itself was fine but left with the story unfinished. It isn't a cliff hanger - rather more like the end of a chapter or the first act of a play.  It did catch my attention though and I'm likely to check out the next one if it's not overly expensive like some shorts or series can be.  This one was free so I do not want to be overly critical because of that and it is not finished. I can't fairly rate something without the whole story. There was one ""love"" scene, not overly done, and there is a slight mystery hinted at.  Kallysten is a good writer but in this story somethings need to be added to add depth & bonding with the heroine.  That alone would raise my rating higher to a 4 star.  I'd recommend if you don't mind waiting for the next ones.  I don't like to wait & would rather have the entire story at one time.  I did like it though.",3

Dr Brigid Adair is a doctor with the Cairns helicopter rescue service, a job she loves for the unique professional challenges it presents every day. When Matt Roberts, an ex US Army medic, joins the crew, Brigid is suddenly faced with a very personal challenge - denying her attraction to her new wealthy, sexy and handsome partner.Rescue Heat starts strongly as Brigid is lowered to treat an ill diver on a deep sea platform and I enjoyed learning a little about the varied role of rescue helicopter teams who deal with urgent life and death situations every day, from searches at sea to assisting with major car accidents. It seemed a shame though that the author didn't really take advantage of the dangers inherent in her protagonists professions to inject more action into the story. I was hoping for a little more edge that would exploit the unique setting and the potential for drama.I really liked the way in which Brigid is portrayed as a confident and competent woman and doctor, she is a strong and likeable character. Matt is the more vulnerable of the two protagonists, still hurt by his ex girlfriend's recent betrayal and adjusting to civilian life after years serving in war zones. Hamilton develops the chemistry between the pair nicely and the intimate scenes are (ok, I am never sure exactly how to describe these scenes) arousing(?), well written anyway.Rescue Heat is a pleasant, quick read that should satisfy fans of contemporary romance set in an exotic locale.",3

This book did not focus on the captivity per se, it was more about the healing that Diana went through.

She works out till she nearly exhausts and hurts herself.  Thankfully, Gideon is there to pick up the pieces and put her back together even though she doesn&#8217;t want the help at first.&#8220;The only woman I want to be with is you, and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to change.&#8221;Gideon is also dealing with some issues.  He beats himself up for not being able to save Diana before she is assaulted.  It is irrational as there was absolutely no way he could have fought off all those men.

He knew that they were meant to be even when she didn&#8217;t.&#8220;You&#8217;re the light that shines on the dark places of my soul, but you are not, you are not my project.&#8221;I wish the reader was able to get some of Gideon&#8217;s POV in this book as it is solely told in Diana&#8217;s POV.  At times, I have to admit she drove me a little crazy. I felt that she was a little wishy-washy at best.  I know that she went through a horrible experience but I hated the way she treated Gideon.  I won&#8217;t lie, I did choke up a couple of times.&#8220;The world isn&#8217;t the one I used to think it was, where the hero rides in to save the day at the very last minute.

With only one real friend to speak of, her social life consists of not much more than going to work in the local library. Since she was a very young girl, she has been convinced that she has a guardian angel watching over her. She feels protected by him from afar. But after a series of events Rachel vows to get to the bottom of her protectors appearances and what she learns about Eaden and herself will change her life in ways she never could have imagined.I found Unbound to be quite a unique and original story. I hadn't read this concept of mortals and immortals being so intricately connected before. I loved learning the back story to the immortals and the consequences of living so long, and where Rachel fits into it all.For the most part the story flowed quite smoothly, but there were occasions when I found things to be a little stilted. I think it may have in some part been to how formal Eaden came across at times. I suppose that comes down to Eaden being 1500 years old.I really found myself enjoying the uncovering of the mysterious Eaden. I found him to be quite a multilayered character. At first he comes across as quite solitary, and that's really how he lives his life. But once Eaden and Rachel begin their journey, we get to know Eaden on a much greater level and he is quite a respected and admired member of his community.Rachel was at times much older than her age. And then at others she seemed so very young. But above all else she is strong when she needs to be. Forced to grow up much quicker than most girls due to the death of her father and her mothers subsequent inability to be a consistent parent.The best part of the story for me was the last third as the action and suspense picked up. This was when I really felt most connected to the characters and was really convinced of the feelings that Rachel and Eaden shared.Unbound started out incredibly promising. I was loving the mystery of being watched over by someone your whole life. Always feeling protected even though you don't really have any great physical contact. Then the story became a little lost in the middle section and I did find my mind straying a bit during that period, but then the pacing and excitement level picked up again in the last third and I was on board again.

There are a lot to like in this book. The characters, especially Daniel Marshall himself but also the mildly crazy shuttle pilot, Orlova, and quite a few of the other characters as well are very enjoyable. The concept of Captain Marshall taking over a battle cruiser and whipping it into shape despite quite a few of the personnel having a few &#8220;issues&#8221; to say the least is a good start of any book. So far so good.Unfortunately the book rather quickly digs itself down in politics, internal strife, sabotage and backstabbing. This takes place not only on the planet they visit but also on the ship itself. These kind of story elements are really not my cup of tea. Quite large parts of the book take place down on the planet as well. With a book titled &#8220;Battlecruiser Alamo&#8221; I would have expected the majority of the book to be about the battlecruiser itself.Speaking of the battlecruiser, I do have a big gripe with the fact that, according to the book, two measly frigates should be able to take on this battlecruiser and have a better than average chance of winning. What the f&#8230;? A battlecruiser should swat two frigates with relative ease.As I said, for me this was a bit of a mixed bag and I ended up feeling this book was neither good nor bad. It is not a very long book and it is quite easy reading so, given that it is the first book in a series and the second one is already out, I am going to give the series another shot before I decide whether this series is for me or not.",3

I quite like jesse the male m/c but also kept thinking there was going to be some big scene with him. He was also was very much the gentlemen with the perfect amount of hotness but I also felt that his personality could have been developed so much more. I just wanted more from him. He is definitely book boyfriend worthy.The female m/c Julia- so the whole concept of Best Served Cold is based around how she is feeling after a bad break up.  There should have been more fire to her. We saw blips of this that were great. I did like that she did not go all crazy stalker b***h though.The secondary characters were just as fun and real. They bring back memories of college days. I would really like to see Giff's story.Overall the story was well written. There weren't any gaping holes or missing pieces. I did feel though that the parts that were there, could have been layered more and built up.It would have been interesting to see what Liam thought of the blog that Julia set up. I would have also been intrigued to see more interaction between characters regarding the blog posts.Best Served Cold is a quick and easy read. The characters are likeable and relatable. The story was an excellent premise that I really would have liked to see it expanded more. There is a second book coming later in 2014. I look forward to seeing where Tawdra Kandle goes with the next story in this series. This would be a great book to get past a book hangover.D3.5/5",3

A lot going on in the short book. I liked how Leah wanted to bond with her sister Audrey. In fairness to the parents of Leah, you always want what is best for your children, but I think they forgot the best for children part. I felt Will had a big strong family and this helped Leah to want to bond with her sister....the parents made the girls feel good girl vs bad girl....and they drifted apart.

B004VTCDYM,A2PW3LUBBOEG05,"05 13, 2014",MoonlightReader,3 1/2 stars!,"Ross and Liza are coming home from a doctor&#8217;s appointment in which they just got bad news; the chances of them ever having children are slim to none.  Driving home they almost get in an accident and swerve off the road.  With the car now broken, Ross decides to look for help and hears a baby crying.  Long story short, that baby becomes their daughter, the child that they wanted but couldn&#8217;t have, Aradia.This was a good book.  I liked how Aradia knew she was special, but didn&#8217;t know why.  She has no clue that she&#8217;s a witch, and it takes them moving to a town of other &#8216;hidden&#8217; beings to figure out what she is.  The story had a nice flow and kept me interested and wanting to go back for more.However, Aradia did get on my nerves.  Her sense of humor was pretty dry, and I kind of felt embarrassed for her on occasion when she tried to be funny.  She felt a little immature as well, but it is a young adult book and she is a young adult.  So it was just her personality, and that&#8217;s fine, she just got on my nerves a bit.It wasn&#8217;t just Aradia who got under my skin; it was her friend Roy too.  I just wish he had more self-confidence; the lack of it was unappealing.  But again, they are young characters.  I&#8217;m hoping that he&#8217;ll gain some confidence through the series.Another little thing that stuck out to me was the mentioning of CVS.  This was when Aradia had just moved to Salem, Massachusetts and she was talking to a student at her school.  She was telling him to pick up some medicine.&#8220;Pick some up on the way home.  It&#8217;s easy to find.  They&#8217;ll have it at CVS.&#8221;&#8220;What&#8217;s CVS?&#8221;&#8220;Oh, right.  Um, Walgreens?  Any drug store (&#8212;)&#8221;  (location 31 on Kindle)Again, this does not affect my rating; I&#8217;m just throwing it out there.  I&#8217;m from the area, and I promise, we know what CVS is (and Walgreens too).  Lol.Besides Miss Aradia not being my favorite person, she did grow on me, and I did enjoy the story.  All in all, a good young adult book and I recommend it.My Rating:  3 1/2 out of 5 stars~Pam*****I received this book free from the author in exchange for an honest review.*****",3

Anna is lying in bed, drowsy and ready to fall asleep, dreaming of the duke, but believing her love for him is impossible. Then she sees him standing in the door.  He comes into the room and tells her he wants to talk to her.He tells her he's found someone for her to marry. Anna's heart falls in disappointment, but then she bravely asks who it is. Jared describes the man and explains how he's grown to love her over the years. It finally dawns on Anna that he's talking about himself. Tears come to her eyes, she's so happy. At first Jared thinks she doesn't return his regard, but then she explains and he pulls her into his arms for a gentle kiss that quickly ignites his passion.Jared wants to do the honorable thing and pulls out of their embrace, telling Anna that they must wait for their marriage before consumating their love, but Anna isn't having any of that. She tells him she doesn't want to wait, that she wants to be his now.This is 28% into the story. From that point on, the sex scene is hot, steamy and goes on for the rest of the story. I've written many sex scenes, but never one that lasts over 30 pages.There might not be much plot, but this was a steamy, hot story and I couldn't put it down. I do agree about the term ""baby"". I don't believe it was used in early 19th century England. The author also referred to Jared's mother as Lady Fairmont, and since she's a duchess that was all wrong.

B004EPYTAE,A1ARJBC8VD5P8P,"12 26, 2010",R.Parklane,A pleasant read but could have been much more.,"I like the idea of the story. A gay man on the verge of entering priesthood finding out just in time what he truly wants and has the courage to change his life. This is what happens to Kevin when he becomes attracted to Chris, a gymn instructor. Theirs is the usual instant attraction but at least the writer gives them a short break when these two young man has a little time to figure out their feelings. However the writer could have dug deeper into Kevin's struggles between his love for God and his ""earthly"" desires. OK so this is a novella and I sense the writer wishes to maintain a lighter tone but more inner turmoil within Kevin would have made the story more convincing. There could have been more follow up on Kevin's feelings after he quit the priesthood. But the story quickly wraps up in the usual way with pages devoted to Kevin's discovery of sex with Chris. Right so this is Kevin's first time but after so many M/M I rather the writer devote more time to the guys' relationship development minus the sex. And the most important question. Did Kevin makes his peace with God ?",3

I was drawn into the story immediately because the premise was unique and intriguing.  She has a way of writing the ends of chapters so that you are compelled to keep reading...I love that.  But, I needed more....a lot more.  I needed more background information, I needed to know more about the Sin collecting ritual...I was curious as to how there were so many ways in which a Sin Collector could ""work the system"" so to speak in order to either a) never collect sins  b) stop collecting sins...it seems that if this is the role of a sin collector, they wouldn't be able to avoid it.My major issue with the story was the character development.  It started off so, so strong and then it got to a point where the author changed direction, and as a reader I was thrown.  I became extremely attached to one character when perhaps that wasn't the intention of the author.  In the same respect, another character was too distant for me, and in the end I didnt feel a pull towards said character that I think I was supposed to feel.I think this book has so much potential, but some changes would need to be made in order for me, as a reader, to really get attached to the characters.  A little more foreshadowing would be necessary and flashbacks would be a great way to explain a little more about Liliana and what it is truly like to be a Sin Collector.",3

A slight spoiler: it's about pedophilia and the ""acceptance"" of it through therapy, which isn't really therapy but that's another story.  But aside from the subject I found myself liking the book.  Now on the other hand- this is not really an American edition.  It's a British edition with a few American cities thrown in there.

Who knew some dating sites could actually work?! So after a few disastrous dates, they take a chance on each other.Patrick decides to give the Gaydate online dating site one more chance when he's sifting through the potential guys. Once they all find out he's a doctor all they want from him is his money. Not going to happen! Than he comes across Trevor, thinking Yes! Finally a guy who looks promising! But experience tells him to take it slow, proposing to get to know each other first by exchanging emails before meeting in person.Trevor can't believe he's trying yet another dating site. His time is limited being an anesthesiologist, helping women feel better about their bodies after recovering from breast cancer. He loves his job, but finding a partner having recently moved to Seattle has become taxing. Somehow his best friend, Callie, talked him into exploring a dating site, so now he's finding himself searching through a list of guys, with so many ""no's"", it's becoming disheartening. Until he sees Patrick.  A major ""YES, Please!"" After they message a few times, he becomes disappointed; Patrick doesn't want to meet but rather for them to get to know each other first in emails. Trevor is left questioning if Patrick is really interested.Despite a few misunderstandings brought on by the inability to gauge emotions through emails, they begin to grow closer. One night Patrick gets a call, Trevor is drunk ... something has happened while at work, he lost a patient: anesthesia causing the woman's heart to fail. It hits Trevor hard. Trevor ends up calling Patrick unknowingly for comfort.The next morning, while they had slept in separate beds the night before, they have breakfast and agree to a date for the coming weekend. During the date they hold hands, share kisses, and go for a long walk, and wait ... Patrick is going down on Trevor without protection? Hello! Aren't these men doctors? Where is the thought for their safety?! This is only the first date! Sigh. Even though this is an Insta-love story I would have liked at least another date before they started smexing!That very night, Trevor proclaims his love to Patrick! Hmm. Patrick is unable to say it back, although he knows his feelings for Trevor are deepening rapidly. The next day, however, starts out well; Patrick gets ready for work and Trevor leaves to run some errands. Two raging homophobic morons put a kink in things, attacking Trevor who tries to flee and almost makes it to a Gay Leather Bar just down the road, only to get tackled before he reaches safety. The incident leaves him being put into a medical induced coma. Patrick, being the ER doctor at the hospital Trevor is brought to, flips. Realizing he loves Trevor just as much, he sets out to make sure Trevor knows just how deep his love is for him!This is a very sweet and easygoing story. The jumping back and forth between POV's with Patrick and Trevor did become slightly annoying at times, as it would tend to back track and you'd end up reading the other's side to what just happened. I really wished it would have stayed to just one character's POV. It did, however, give you a good look into each character's growth through this building relationship.I hope you like a lot of smexing, because once these two come together, it's hard to get them to stop! Maybe a tad bit too much sex for such a short book? That being said, despite the things I didn't quite like, I still rather enjoyed reading Perfect Match. I would give this a rating of 3.

From almost the first, I knew the kind of historical accuracy I expect in a historical novel of any type was lacking.  Descriptions of the fort are not accurate in the least.  People in this period did not use the term &#34;lunch&#34; for the noon meal.  The Cherokee Indians who lived near the Fort had all been forced from their homes in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky by Andrew Jackson's Indian Removals.  For the Cherokee (and I am proud to have some Cherokee in my own DNA) the trail of tears was a tragic event.  Cherokees DID not scalp anyone nor did they attack stage coaches (which the entire premise that the stage coach veered so far off course is ridiculous) so I am both appalled and offended by the &#34;slaughter&#34; depicted in the book.  Furthermore, there is a reason why the Cherokees are one of the &#34;Five Civilized Tribes&#34;.  The Cherokees removed to Oklahoma were not wild savages - back east, they were plantation owners and farmers, many of them wealthy.  This is historical fact.

A beautiful, passionate charter pilot who loves this remote Maine island, Maggie has never cared much for outsiders-until her latest passenger arouses the curiosity of the town . . . and something hot and irresistible in Maggie. With his long, lean looks and razor-sharp wit, the man is temptation itself.  Cop-turned-PI Dexter Keegan is on a covert mission to solve the case that will make his career: uncovering the identity of the Stanhope heir, kidnapped nearly a century ago. No one on this fiercely protective island can know what he's doing, not even the spirited, blue-eyed beauty who infuriates-and excites-Dex. As the desire between them ignites, Maggie becomes the key to the case . . . and the target of an unknown enemy. Now Dex will do anything to protect the woman he's come to love-even risk his own life.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:  Anna Sullivan was born and raised in southeastern Michigan, the seventh of nine children, whose claim to fame was reading five books a week in grade school. Needless to say, her obsession with the written word only grew from there-despite a short, and misguided, foray into the world of computer science (the 'sensible' job path). She still lives in Michigan, with her husband, three children and two dogs whose life of leisure she envies but would never be able to pull off.MY THOUGHTS ON THE BOOK:  I enjoyed reading this book. It has an good story with a wicked suspense element and I am looking forward to seeing just where it goes in the next book.  I wouldn't call this book a cliffhanger not all of the mystery is solved in this story. Maggie, the heroine is my only problem with this book is the heroine. She was  abrasive and I am not really sure how Dex managed to have ANY feelings for her.  Even though she was not one of my favorite characters that does not remove the fact that Dex and Maggie did have some pretty spectacular chemistry. I think I would have liked to see a little more tenderness and a little less spark.  I am looking forward to the next book which will be the story of Jessie and Hold.STATEMENT OF DISCLOSURE: I received an paperback copy of this title from Netgalley as part of their blogger review program .

Homecoming: A Cloaked Devices Short Story by Cecilia Robert,"3.5 out of 5 starsHomecoming is the introductory novella to what promises to be a very interesting 'shifter' series.  Homecoming is the 'establishment' chapter of the series in which we are introduced to the main characters and get a fairly detailed description/understanding of the environment, culture and context for the story.  Roberts has created, with very intricate detail, a society filled with shape shifters, humans with the ability to bend air, fire and earth, ships that fly ... it's absolutely amazing in fact.  The characters are incredibly intriguing.  Levian and Tegue, twin brothers and panther shifters; Sera also a panther shifter and mate to Levian; Uriel a human that can bend air and fire.The focus of Homecoming is on finding Sera and her return to the clan home.  Her departure, on the night of her mating ceremony with Levian, was unexpected and it has taken Levian five years to track her down. As the story unfolds we begin to understand the connection between Levian and Sera and the reasons for her mysterious departure.  I enjoyed the way the story unfolded and felt that I develped a good understanding of each of the characters.While the start was a little slow, I gradually found myself immersed in the story, wanting so much to happen between the characters.  There were sections where great detail was provided, although sometimes it was too much for me as I worried I would need to retain the detail for future instalments in the series.  In other sections things were glossed over a little when I would have liked more detail - which will no doubt be forthcoming in future books in the series.  There were some minor editorial issues in the version I was reading, which were a little distracting at times.  But overall I enjoyed Roberts writing style and her ability to engage me as a reader.While this is a novella, it provides a good introduction to the series.  There is no cliffhanger as such, but obviously there are lots of unanswered questions when you get to the end of Homecoming.  I will add future instalments in the series to my TBR list as I would really like to see what unfolds in this series.Visit the Into the Night Reviews blog or Facebook page for book reviews, new release updates, giveaways and more!!",3

Friendships were made and old ones tested.Natalie Pepper is a Cali girl intent on making it in the concrete jungle. Having moved her life&#8217;s belongings (which weren&#8217;t exactly extensive) to NYC on the first chance she got might have come across as impulsive, but she&#8217;s determined to prove to her father and sister that she has what it takes to succeed. Failure is not an option. Although she immediately finds a job as a marketing director, surviving on Ramen doesn&#8217;t quite allow for frugal spending. Adapting to the city that never sleeps isn&#8217;t exactly a piece of cake. There&#8217;s also the daily torture of working with two gorgeous men, one hot as sin (Damon) and the other with the most amazingly mood-lifting smile (CJ). A girl can get pretty lonely in a big city, especially when your roommate has seemingly made it her mission to have zero contact with you. Thankfully, her new job comes with the perk of a vivid social night life flowing with free booze and eligible men. Too bad the only one that refuses to leave her thoughts is the one she can&#8217;t cross the line with for fear of inflicting chaos in her otherwise orderly life.Candace Kanie has had a privileged upbringing and doesn&#8217;t have to worry about the high price of real estate in NYC thanks to dear ol&#8217; mom and dad. Taking up residence in their Manhattan apartment, she&#8217;s ready to take on the finance world with the same ambition and determination she tackles life. Not one for waiting for opportunity to come knocking; she crashes a dot com party, befriends Natalie and lands herself a job interview by the end of the night. Once acquiring employment, her next step was fulfilling her romantic life which definitely proved to be more difficult than ever imagined. Upon meeting Damon (Natalie&#8217;s hot as sin co-worker), she fell instantly in lust and pseudo-love, convinced that he was her happily-ever-after. Never had a man held such power over her the way that Damon did and although she was a bit disturbed by it, it didn&#8217;t deter her plans of pursuing such a perfect male specimen. Surely the undeniable mutual attraction must mean that they are meant to be. Soon enough, a wrench or two are thrown into both Candace&#8217;s personal and professional making her question her choices.Coming from different walks of life, Natalie and Candace along with her friends learn that not everything is as it seems. They encounter and overcome obstacles while learning more about themselves and each other. I was drawn to this book by its SATC-esque appeal but it took me a while to get into it and it sort of fell short. The writing was fun and entertaining but the situations the girls were caught in, especially when it was love related, really tested my patience. They were infuriating at times with the catty drama. I was torn between cheering on one of the characters and slapping some sense into her (poor CJ).The story kind of redeemed itself towards the end. Even though I didn&#8217;t fall in love with the book, I am curious to see where the author goes with the series. Men and Martinis is a light, witty read with a pseudo-cliffhanger that will have you pining for what happens next.",3

The writing was good and thank God there were none of those irritating typos and grammatical errors.This sequel gave us more to question than it answered. For instance, why did the Drakes do what they did? What is Steve up to? What happened to Aviva that she refuses to tell Jason? And as vindictive as Diane is are we just to believe that she's just going to fade away. And finally, there's MacKenzie who was barely mentioned in book one but is now a love interest for Jake? And what her and Aviva did by following the brothers was just asinine and pointless.I also feel that there was way to much detail of not only the outfit the brothers chose to wear for battle but also the weapons and let's not forgot the tedious retelling of how they tracked Aviva. I found myself more times than I care to admit, wanting to skip sections of this book.Even with all of the above mentioned, the book did flow well, I love the relationship between the brothers and for the most part the story was interesting.

I enjoyed the story, I likes the way it was told in first person, Lilianne was a fun heroine and grew in strength as the story progressed. The author did a good job of character development on most of the other characters as well. I agree Lili seemed to be immature to be as old as she really was, but since she isolated herself from humans so much I can accept that part of her personality.I enjoyed the idea of sin collectors, a new concept to me, as I like books that are any type of paranormal mystery. I can see where this might be a good first book leading to a series.However: (Spoiler alert) you cannot travel by yacht to Madrid. I was engrossed in the book up to the yacht traveling to Madrid, it would have been a good idea to flesh out that area of the book then with development of other characters. The author had them travel four days. Having not traveled by yacht I am not sure how long it takes to get from Ireland to Spain. At least Dublin is a port city. Madrid is in the middle of Spain. There are no major waterways you can take to get there. You would have to stop at a Spanish port or Lisbon and fly, drive or take the train to get there. That should have been addressed.One reason I ordered the book was the mention of Madrid in some reviews. Having spent six weeks there last year I wanted to revisit the city through the book. Lavapies is a great neighborhood to have the final meeting with ""the bad guys"" but more fleshing out of getting there and walking into the building would have been helpful.The book was good, interesting first try, it could have been much better with some more elaboration.",3

Mia has a huge secret.  To her family she's an unemployed college graduate who dabbles in Wicca and has no career prospects.  In reality, Mia is a powerful witch learning to harness her magic under her mentor Jessa.  When her long-time crush, Ethan, arrives on leave from the Army the two of them get caught up in an adventure that will change their lives forever.  With only each other to lean on and years of attraction between them they must decide whether to trust in love or go their separate ways.Ethan is your typical alpha male lead.  He's hot, well built (thanks to the Army), and fiercely protective of Mia.  In his mind she is out of his reach but that doesn't stop him from wanting her and aching to close the gap that exists between them.  I would have liked a little more character development before his world was turned upside down and I thought he accepted the supernatural world's existence a bit too easily.  However, I appreciated his internal struggle when it came to his relationships with Mia and her brother/his best friend Nolan.Mia could have used more development, too.  She seems very closed off and lonely.  She exists in a world where not many really know who she is and that includes her family.  Mia tries very hard to fit into a mold that she thinks will make her family love and accept her.  However that wasn't the impression I got from her family.  Her parents seem very laid back and I felt like they would have understood had she come clean with them about her magic.  I got the sense that her brother, Nolan, knew she was hiding things from him and wanted nothing more than her honesty.  Plus, he seemed to be pushing Mia and Ethan together a little at times.  It's almost as though Makela underestimated her characters and it showed through in the story.I enjoy a quick read and it's nice to finish a book in one sitting....BUT...the pacing here is off in comparison to amount of story Makela is trying a get through.  I honestly think the book would have been better had Mia just been a known witch.  Had that been the case, Makela could have focused the story on the werewolves without all the angst of Mia hiding her powers, too.  Perhaps Makela will adjust these things in subsequent books to come.  For now, I will continue the journey with these characters and see where the road leads.*I was given a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*Shannon, My Secret Book Spot",3

It was cute and fluffy and fun. I had a pleasant time reading this short story, but a few irksome hitches took away some of the enjoyment, so I figured I&#8217;d point them out for future reference.The first problem I noticed stems from my own personal issue with the grammar used towards the beginning of the book. Is it just me, or was the first part of the story stilted in some way? It seemed like the author didn&#8217;t use contractions as much as she should have in the first part for the story. This made the dialogue seem way too formal than it should be for a paranormal romance. (I may be completely wrong about what made the writing seem awkward. This is just what I noticed; if you found something as well, be sure to point it out in the comments!)Second, the sex scenes were sexy in regards to Kade&#8217;s extreme(ly hot) potty mouth, but that's kinda where it stopped for me. The sex scenes were overly descriptive and almost clinical. Thankfully, I was more interested in the character&#8217;s relationships than the sex, so it wasn&#8217;t a huge biggie, but for others it might.All-in-all, it was an adorable story, and for $.99 it can do no wrong.

B008P4LJG2,AYCF72ZF9NHSO,"10 8, 2012",Angelina K,"A good read, but flawed.","I borrowed this book from the Kindle Lending Library.  It was a sexy story about two co-workers who essentially hook up casually, even though they both have deeper feelings for each other.  In many ways it was a lovely story. The combination of the Hart family (and the sisters) was a great one.  I really felt their connection. I really liked the H - he was sexy, caring, posessive of the heroine, and a great dirty talker. The heroine was also a good character, although she tended to have a very black+white personality with very little grey. It was really all or nothing with her every time.The biggest issue for me was the formatting of the book.  There was a double line between every single paragraph in the book and holy heck was that distracting. I tried changing font size and fooling around with other kindle options, but it just drove me bananas the entire time.But beyond that, I also felt that some of the dialogue was completely flat. It wasn't always that way, but many conversations between the H and h just felt awkward and unnatural to me.  The scene after her dance, for example.  There were a few, though.  And, the main conflict resolution was strangely quick. She decided how it was going to be and it just was.",3

Mica Cruz is transferring to the station and hoping for a fresh start.  As soon as these two meet, they are immediately attracted to each other.  But Grey is straight, or at least he thinks he is.  As Grey and Mica explore their attraction, and Grey comes to grips with the fact that he's gay, they must also deal with the threats against Mica.I enjoyed the beginning of this story, especially several of the sex scenes with Mica's dirty talk.  Mica and Grey are both really nice guys, and they love their jobs.  It was great to see them spend time with the other firefighters and get an idea of life in the firehouse.  I loved the camaraderie between all of the guys and thought it gave some warmth to the story.  There wasn't really a lot of relationship building or heavy conversations taking place.  It seemed like every time there was an opportunity to have a discussion, sex took precedence. The suspense angle allowed for them to spend more time together and move their relationship forward even faster.If you're looking for a heavy erotic romance with sexy firemen and a little suspense, this should make for a fun romp.Reviewed by KindleRomancefor TheRomanceReviews.com",3

This writer is an old pro, so she has few problems peopling her tale and bringing it forward to conclusion.  But the characters, including the hero and heroine, come off a bit two-dimensional.The major redeeming factor is the plot twist: this is a boy meets girl, girl rescues boy and decides to keep him sort of romance, and you root for the characgters because they must act out of character.  Originally this was a collection of two tales of best friends' weddings.  The seque into the follow up story sounds interesting enough to make me want to get it as well.

Fine this may not fit into the flow of the story but at least give her a break and show that she can maybe live normally for a second at the end or beginning of the book for a few pages. Piper at one point goes off on Jade for everything being about her. Yes the book is about Jade but she has not known some of the character for that long (maybe a year or so at this point?)

B004T3AXEW,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,"08 20, 2011",drkhimxz,Listening to Loose Screw with Kindle Robot,"With all the usual qualifications as to robot reading, this book comes off well on Kindle. It follows the path of the increasingly prevalent generic mystery, girl talk with best friend about boys, girl worries about self and about self vis-a-vis boy, temporary denouement with boy (nature determined by overall intentions for  for series), subordinate mystery plot to serve romantic purposes. Some of these books are very, very successful, others are routine, run of the mill efforts, others never rise to the level of general readability. Of course, there are many gradations within these categories and, completely  outside the boundaries of this type are the romances created by such Masters/Mistresses of the detective story as Dorothy Sayers for whom romance (Lord Peters love for the reluctant Harriet Vane)is intrinsic to classic mysteries.With that in mind, I am sure any potential reader should take my star ratings with the usual tablespoon of salt. I am growing weary of this sub-genre as it becomes an increasingly popular fashion among writers (presumably because it is increasingly popular with readers). So far as I can make out this is a readable book which should bring enjoyment to those who are delighted by this kind of book. The lead character needs work from the author to become more of a substantial figure and more credible as a person who would generate respect from others in her social environment. The animal character, it is essential these days to have the right kind of dog or cat, or assortment of these and perhaps horses, cows or others, to share one's living space, is about right. He is a big but non-aggressive dog, who will, no doubt, be given even more space as the series proceeds. The best friend is a bit nebulous but has been given the basic characteristics which can be built upon to make her properly eccentric with the usual heart of gold. Whether the heroin's on-again, off-again, newspaper career will engender an interesting feature is yet to be shown; her basic identity in this book is as owner of an antique shop (with her best friend being a neighbor with a book shop).All in all, the author and her readers, should look forward to additional books in the series.

I must say that Harris has a good story here that will appeal to readers who like YA suspense/mystery. This isn&#8217;t to say that the book is a mystery, but there are elements that leave you guessing as to what is going on with each turn of the page. While there were two things stopping me from absolutely loving this novel, the characters and plot kept me interested and wanting to find out what happens next. I definitely plan to read the next book when it becomes available.I liked Donna and I enjoyed watching her grow as the story progressed. When you first meet her, she&#8217;s quiet, reserved, preferring to blend in and not make any waves, but towards the end she has more confidence, becomes braver and isn&#8217;t afraid to stand up for her friends and do what is right to protect them. She quickly became a favorite of mine out of all of the characters in the story. I also liked Paul, Spencer, Rebecca, and Becky; all of whom are secondary characters who I&#8217;d like to see and learn more about in future books. The only character that I had issues with was Ryan and that was because I couldn&#8217;t decide whether I liked him or wanted to throw him in the same category as Randy and Lynn, both of whom I disliked immensely. He didn&#8217;t really strike me as being all that great a guy and though he&#8217;s Donna&#8217;s childhood friend, he comes across as a major jerk most of the time. It will be interesting to see what happens to him and whether my feelings towards him change at all come the next book in the series.Plot wise, the story was enjoyable, though I felt that there was still a lot that was left unanswered. The book ends on a cliff hanger, which makes sense when you consider that it&#8217;s the first of a five book series. The one question that I would have liked to have seen answered was what was it that made Donna who she is? There is no explanation for this and it&#8217;s not until the very end that you even get a feel for what she is. Yes, I know it creates an air of mystery and drives readers to pick up the rest of the books when they become available, but I hate when the biggest question in a book goes unanswered until later in the series. Still, the story will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you wanting more, that much is a definite, murr!The biggest problem that I had with the book, and the one that kept me from really enjoying it, was there were way too many different point of views happening, often times within one chapter. This made it extremely difficult to become immersed in the story and it made the entire book feel choppy (and yes, there are editorial issues as well, but these are minor when compared to the POV issue). I think the entire story could have worked better with just Donna and Ryan&#8217;s points of views being told. Either that or have one chapter dedicated to each character and alternate that way. As it was, with all the different characters being introduced and sharing their stories, the story felt like a jumbled mess. I&#8217;m not say that I didn&#8217;t like the other character&#8217;s POVs, but this was over kill pure and simple. However, I would like to point out that Harris did a wonderful job tying them all together; there was only one that stood out as not needing to be there.So when all is said and done I have to say that while this wasn&#8217;t the most stand out of books I&#8217;ve ever read, it definitely was one of the more interesting and my curiosity is piqued to see what Harris has in store for the second book. Would I recommend this to other readers? Yes, because despite the problems within the manuscript, the story has potential. I&#8217;m looking forward to watching Harris&#8217; writing develop. =^.^=",3

Unfortunately she is caught before she can go back to the kindred ship waiting for her. Lady Popenose has her implanted with a slut button and sells her at a local bazaar.The story held a lot of adventure and even romance, but what I did not like is it revolved  a good portion of the story in a sex slave location where woman were beaten and sexually degraded. Also Maggie was so insecure in her decisions about her own life it became annoying. I mean she has two PHDs and her fianc&eacute; is a jerk but she feels she needs to stay with him and pass up on true love with Kor a man who risked his own freedom to save her. REALLY!!!The biggest problem I had with the story is not about the story line though. I have noticed in the last couple of her books that the editing really needs to be looked at. She would be writing about certain characters and get their names wrong or just have words missing in the sentence so it did not make sense. This is something the author might want to look into just to fix. I know these are self published as she has written before but there was never a problem in the past books up to book 6. I just think looking into this would benefit her. Especially the name situation. There is nothing more confusing when she is writing about say Maggie and then puts Kats name in her place.

Cottrell ""RiverwoodWriter""",Rollicking adventure,"I could easily be talked into giving this four stars for its high adventure, intriguing mystery and appealing characters. You've got to love a book that grabs you right from the beginning:""Are we rising again?"" ""No on the contrary."" ""Are we descending?"" ""Worse than that, captain! We are falling!"" ""For heavens sake heave out the ballast!"" ""There! The last sack is empty!"" ""Does the balloon rise?"" ""No!"" ""I hear a noise like the dashing of waves! The sea is below the car. It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!"" ""Overboard with every weight!...everything!""I must say, that listening to this (via the Kindle's speech feature while I was driving) was better than having to read all those exclamation points, but I was hooked and enjoyed the vicarious adventure.Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND embraces the ever-popular story line of men surviving--even thriving--on a deserted island, but instead of getting there by shipwreck, these men have escaped from a Civil War Richmond under siege in a hot air balloon and are blown thousands of miles off course in the grip of a raging storm. Eventually, their balloon loses air and they fall into the sea and are washed up on an island. There they establish a settlement, and with remarkable know-how, tenacity, and courage, they make quite a nice life for themselves that lasts about four years, despite the challenges of tempest, wild animals, injuries, pirates, and, most intriguingly, a mysteriously benevolent but invisible presence that seems to defy the castaways' belief that they are alone on the island.This book was written in 1874, and must surely have been influenced by SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON which was written in 1812. The similarities are striking in the remarkably clever things the castaways envisioned, built or fabricated to ensure their comfort and safety...everything from their lodging and outbuildings to a small sailing ship. Between them, they conveniently brought extensive knowledge of engineering, sailing, ship-building, astronomy, geography, botany, and chemistry.The book does bog down occasionally, and the 19th century language is somewhat stilted. Every conversation seemed to include a ""my boy"" or ""my man""  or ""my friend"" (e.g., ""'No doubt, my boy,' answered the engineer...""). The characters were ennobled by the author to be unrealistic paradigms of 19th century virtue: industrious, courageous, practical, and compassionate.But these are quibbles in the face of the pleasure given by such a good story, and the way Jules Verne tied this book in with the story from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA was an interesting and unexpected twist. This book is a classic for a reason.",3

B00F8F3KDG,A3FR6GNAMHJ6RG,"03 31, 2014","Francesca Huber ""Anehalia""",Slow Middle; Interesting Concept,"This book sounded interesting and it started off really well. It starts off with a rivalry between two boys studying a martial art form in a monastery to a goddess.The first time the author switched the main character though, my enjoyment of the story jumped way down. I hate main character switching and the trend toward this in modern stories is horrifying. Every time an author switches heads I am jarringly yanked out of the flow of the story and thrust into a new story; often this is done without any warning leaving me confused as to who I am reading about for a paragraph or tow. Once I realize the author has shifted I have to go back and reread the part I just read because I realize it was from a different perspective.The worst part was the author switched to a character that was the antagonist and was not a character that I could relate to. He was the main antagonist, or so I thought. Even with this double perspective though he continued to be the antagonist and a whiny brat to boost.I thought the idea of the gods that everyone worshiped but different people worshiped one over the other an interesting idea. The idea of a different fighting style for each one was also interesting. This book had a lost to say on racism and religious intolerance, and I enjoyed how the author approached this.But then the book started to drag. All I wanted to do was finish the book and it kept dragging.I came to realize that the one God religion was an analogy for Christians, and most specifically for Catholics. The one God religion forgives you for your sins no matter what you do. As long as you ask for forgiveness after you do something, its OK. All your sins will be forgiven. Forgiveness is a part of the Catholic church, but to be forgiven you have to be truly sorry, swear never to do it again, and have not premeditated it knowing you would be forgiven.The antagonist at one points decides to commit a crime because its for the one God and he could be forgiven later. All that mattered was he fulfill a prophesy. This is the main example of the forgiveness thing I mentioned.This book seems highly influenced by the idea behind the crusades which is that anyone who does not believe in God must be destroyed in his name. For this crusade though, the people never have to leave their land. All they have to do is kill the heretics in the cities.There were also lost of questions left unanswered that I hope the author would answer in a sequel.I enjoyed the beginning and the end of this book. The fight scenes were well written and enjoyable. The story flowed fairly well except for when changing characters. The middle of the book was slow, but filled with interesting concepts.I liked the book for the most part and would recommend this to boys/men that like action filled fantasy books.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group &#8211; Hydra in return for an honest review.",3

This story centers around Jane, an unmarried, pregnant model, with a strong Christian upbringing.  While there are certainly some extremely unsettling moments in this novella (the house that she modeled at was particularly good!), the story then moved into some more &#34;common areas&#34; that took a bit away from that intensity, IMO.  I didn't find Jane's character particularly believable as she kept contradicting herself on her own beliefs throughout.

I was hoping for a fun, rock-star swoon-worthy read. It was OK. Not great, not horrid. The 'paranormal' aspect was probably the least favorite part of the book for me.I liked Jesse, and I liked the seemingly 'real' challenges of life for famous rock-stars, but I wasn't head over heels for Lex. He was kinda creepy to me.  I mean... famous, dark rock star that seems to have some 'new age' kick and is CONVINCED that Jesse is his lost love from a previous life.  Rich or not, swoony voice or not... that's bordering on creepy stalker territory.The romance... when we are reading about their 'dates', I can feel it.  It seems realistic and believable, and Lex is not so creepy.  When they are around each other NOT on dates... it gets weird.  I guess I could have overlooked other less desirable parts of the story if I really got swept up in the swoon.  I stayed up late reading this, I really expected to get caught in the swoon, but it never happened.So... was it worth reading, Sure. Will I read it again? Probably not.

Knowing this, too, is a &#34;sequel to...CURVES FOR THE LONE ALPHA&#34; helped put this story in perspective.I enjoyed the shifter elements.  Made for a fun paranormal read.  James's character as a Lone Alpha was endearing...all the good he did for a struggling leaderless pack.  I enjoyed watching James and Carrie realize the sizzling, lusty connection between himself and Carrie was far more than just physical attraction.  It's obvious to me (as the characters realized) that they belong together!  The BBW elements rang true.  I could believe Carrie's baggage related to her overweight body; it was rewarding to see her feel beautiful....because James brings out the BEST in her and his love changes everything.  Just what romance should be!  I liked Carrie's sassy first-person point of view.The storytelling had a lot to recommend it.  Yet the presentation fell flat in several areas:~ typos could've been caught by a good editor (a comma inside of a word it should have followed, capital letters where they didn't belong [dialogue tag], several missing periods at end of sentences, etc., etc.)~ While there IS a HEA...there wasn't much resolution between these two.  Just a little more than make-up sex would have made it a far more satisfying read.  Carrie hints at a secret...maybe she's not ready to tell James, but one single sentence would've helped me, the reader, not feel cheated.  After all THAT was about the relationship, not about the greater ongoing story.  Shutting the reader out isn't a good idea.~ it wasn't evident whether the champagne was drugged.  After all, the writing implied the bottle was uncorked in front of them, and everyone partook....so, how did she get so sleepy?Recommended to fans of spicy shifter romances.",3

The romance scenes are hot and quick and they usually start with a fight. The story is told by bouncing back and forth between the lead character's points of view- which is good because Serena's internal monologue is kind of boring.There was a lot of time spent rehashing Lux World details for new readers, but Hunter is more forthcoming  about hard truths than Daemon ever is so that's refreshing.The downsides are that the book is very formulaic and their is little character building. The two leads are physically attracted to each other, get in an argument, submit to their hormones, get it on, then realize that their romance will never work and push each other away. It was cool to see the Luxen as the bad guys from the Arum perspective, but I really didn't care that much whether Serena lived or died except that it would have derailed Hunter from his path to humanization (He does have the bad boy-you-think-you-can-save thing going on).

The Home Baker's Glossary of Terms, Ingredients and Measurements (In the Pantry Baking Standards)features an extensive, though by no means all-inclusive list of common baking terms.  Beginning cooks and bakers will find this reference guide worth a look, but do be aware that there are some problems and the book is not always accurate or authoritative.First, the Table of Contents, which is very close to the left edge, will take you to the part of the alphabet you want, but perhaps only after several tries.  I gave up and ended up paging through by hand.There are some misspellings that may perhaps confuse the new baker.  One that comes immediately to mind is Kipferi with an i instead of the correct spelling, Kipferl with an L.  Also missing are alternative spellings where appropriate.  One that stuck out to me was Gugelhupf as an alternative spelling for Kugelhupf.  This particular cake is made all over the Alsace region of France, all of Germany, Austria and parts of Switzerland, with the spelling changing from place to place.  They are both ""correct"".Standard abbreviations are either incorrect or missing.  While the author does include a variety of alternate abbreviations for tablespoon that once appeared in recipes, the standard abbreviation for many decades has been Tbsp rather than T.  A similar situation exists for teaspoon - correct standard abbreviation tsp. not t. The ""M"" section drove me mad.  There is virtually no explanation of the metric system, never mind conversions, and Joyce has entirely omitted the everywhere-but-in-the-US definition for ""mince.""Some of the terminology that most often needs definition in today's world of international recipe exchange revolves around sugar.  I was especially disappointed that Joyce did not include the terms Caster Sugar and Icing Sugar, probably the single most common cause of confusion around when it comes to using European or Australian baking recipes.Joyce's description of the book led me to believe that I would find appropriate substitutions.  Not so much.  If you want to know how to substitute cocoa for chocolate in a recipe, you are going to have to look elsewhere.  She defines the X as in 10X in relation to sugar as the number of holes per inch in the screen used to form the crystals.  That is news to me.  Every authoritative definition I have ever heard of the X's in relation to sugar state that X refers to the fineness of the grind.  The more Xs, the finer the sugar has been ground.There are no pictures.  If this were a cookbook I wouldn't complain, but sometimes one teeny picture is worth hundreds of words.  A few pictures wouldn't have gone amiss here.All in all, not bad but could be much better.PS - My mother taught English.  The ""mother's daughter"" in me is aghast at the title.

The premise of this story intrigued me, but as I read on, I frequently found myself confused as to what was actually happening. The erotic elements to the story were well-done, but the other plot devices were sometimes fuzzy and I had to re-read sections to get my bearings.While I hate an information dump, I do like to be led along in order to discover how the mythos of the story works. I had a hard time getting that. Perhaps a little more explanation in the beginning would have helped. I loved the otherworldly futuristic feel of this book, and that coupled with the sexual chemistry of the characters kept me reading.Ms. Markowitz pens an interesting and exciting world, however, I wish it had flowed better for me. The characters were engaging and the dialogue was pertinent and reflective of the genre.

Truthfully, I had a hard time loving Stockton's character. He was a little too sappy for my taste, and there were times he kept going on about Cami in what was supposed to be a romantic way but annoyed me a little. Also the pet names were strange. There's just nothing sexy about calling someone a ""Hillbilly"".The other issue I had while reading this book was it seemed rushed and somewhat forced. I didn't think their chemistry was developed well. It lacked that yummy tension and anticipation that I always feel in Rachel's other books.

Journalists Kari Erntemann and Jerry Peterson are cross-country lovers who fight for the good of both America and Europe. As immigration becomes a hostile environment across both Europe and North America, the journalists must fight against the tyrant behind the illegal work permits, scandals, murder, and more.Can Europe's native IT workforce, like Dan Mandeville, keep work while an influx of immigrants with IT degrees come flooding across the borders or will Europe close it's eyes and leave the justice handling to someone else?What would someone do to keep their job? And what if what they did was caught on film?Rating: 6.5/10.0Review: At 48% done (according to the Kindle), the book took off and began pushing the four separate stories together rapidly and interestingly. The ties between the four stories are subtle at first and caused the story to drag on for a while. Because it took quite a long time to get into the attractiveness of the story, I had to give it a lower score. I did enjoy the book over all, and I believe that if I was interested in politics and followed the immigration issues, the book would have been even more enjoyable but I'm not on either focus and it wasn't until the crimes started piling up that I became interested. I reached out to someone I knew who was deep into politics and immigration law following in the US (IABookReviews is located in the US) and they were interested in reading the book.

B002BX87E0,A15IRM5PNJUKP7,"12 6, 2012",Mountaineer,A romance on another world,"3.5 stars for this short, enjoyable, explicit romance.  Tropes include revenge, abandonment, and insta-love. It's cloaked as science fiction, but it's ROMANCE. As such, it's just fine, but I much prefer Andrews' straight-up urban fantasies. It's not that I dislike romance -- sometimes that's exactly what I want (but not from Team Andrews).This is book 1 of the Kinsmen series. Book 2 is out, too. My main problem with Silent Blade is the insta-love trope. It didn't work for me, so then the sex didn't move me either. The relationship development relied on sex too much, maybe? I am guessing the length (42 pages) constrained the authors.Setting: Another world, inhabited by humans with special implants and ruled by a few different  Kinsman  or  Kin  families who have special inborn powers. (Think Mafia families ruling their financial empires, killing off the competition.)Characters: The hero (Celino Carvannas) is a rich and ruthless Kinsman, good with knives, 32 years old, ""tall, lean, and overwhelmingly masculine"" (of course). The heroine (Meli Galdes) is an outcast Kinsman, excised from her family, and -- because of her ability to slay instantly with an energy ribbon -- she has become a world-class assassin.Plot: Meli's family asked her to do one last killing for them (even though she's been excised for 12 years, she still does their dirty work??) Celino is the target. We are never told exactly WHY they want him dead, but I suppose it's because his business is outperforming their business.But there's a twist to this assassination assignment. She knows her target. She was only 10 when their joint parents, seeking to combine power, arranged for the two to become engaged. He was 16. She studied him, as a good wife-in-waiting should do in this feudal society, and in the course of learning, she crushed, pinning all her hopes and dreams on him. But at age 22 (to her 16) he broke the engagement -- not kindly or tactfully at all -- causing her to become untouchable, an outcast, eventually an assassin.When they meet again 12 years later he doesn't recognize her, because she was always veiled in the past. Insta-luv! He strode into the kitchen in the restaurant, smelled her passion cones (talkin' biscuits!), saw her lush curves, met her rich coffee-brown eyes...After he left, Meli smiled with satisfaction. ""It took almost 18 years, from the skinny 10-year-old girl to the 28-year old woman, but Mother proved right. She hit him like a brick.""So....will she kill him, or won't she? Will he figure out that she's the girl he tossed to the curb? If so, will he suffer and grovel?  (I do like a good grovel).Not much action. Minimal suspense. Not much to make it qualify as sci-fi or paranormal. This is a romance novel, with explicit sex and several  references to honey and breasts. The language is clean. Not much violence. Nothing gory.",3

Rose ""Miss Rose Rose""",Flawed but compulsively readable,"(In the interest of full disclosure, I should state first that I count author Jamie Wyman as a friend, although geography and time constraints have sadly prevented us from becoming close.  I was more than a little apprehensive, therefore, about reading her book; not that I thought her incapable of writing something good, but because I hate having to tell someone I genuinely like and respect that the project they've loved and labored over has serious problems and may well be stillborn. Tl;dr:  this is not one of those projects.  So without further ado...)Phew.  I think I need a cigarette.Not-quite-three-hundred pages of Cat Sharp's whirlwind 24 hours all over Vegas is enough to wear anyone out.  Twists piling on top of turns, betrayals and counter-betrayals.  And like the best Vegas stories, the stakes are high - Cat's very freedom is at stake.Whirlwind or no, the pacing is one of this story's strongest attributes.  If the pages were physical, they would practically spark as you turned them, scathing remarks and witty rejoinders flying back and forth in quick brief flashes.  There's just the right amount of time for the characters to catch their breath before the next crisis, and the next, until the big climactic scene.Unfortunately, the breakneck pace seems to cost more than a little clarity.  The rules of the story are not well-defined (what exactly is it that magical beings can do with her soul? what are their limits?); and while a certain amount of opacity is justifiable (as Cat herself doesn't understand the entirety of what's going on and is fumbling around based on a notoriously unreliable goddess' word), it was unclear to this reader precisely why she was pursuing the MacGuffin.  At times it seemed implied that she would gain her freedom, at others merely the possibility to better her circumstances, and either way it's never quite delineated how the magic poker chips are supposed to work.  Or, indeed, what they signify - if Cat was collecting them to gain her freedom, why did the gods flick them over to her so easily once she confronted them?  Similarly, while I could understand Cat's overwhelming desire to regain possession of her soul, I couldn't quite follow her willingness to trust the word of a goddess who had proved her untrustworthiness on multiple occasions.  Even with nothing else to go on, she seemed resourceful enough to find some way of verifying Eris' word and perhaps gaining a better understanding of what was going on; even with the human tendency to ignore better sense when offered what we desire most, the blind acceptance just didn't fit with Cat's world-weary persona.That particular issue aside, however, the characterization was a goodly part of what made this story so much fun.  Wyman's characters have great chemistry, and their back-and-forth made me giggle aloud more than once.  I felt that Marius, as the love interest, got slightly short shrift in his development; there were hints that there might be more to him than snark, but his development seemed to be wildly outpaced by the growing of Cat's attraction to him.  Similarly, the resolution of his character arc fell a tad flat; I think if he'd gotten a touch more development it would have had more emotional impact.My last criticism (really!  I promise!) is more in the grey area of stylistic issues, and may well just be personal preference, but:  one of the things I liked most about Cat was her agency and resourcefulness.  So it was more than a little jarring to have her biggest character flaw be crippling self-doubt.  Again, this is probably tied in to the pacing; if we'd gotten to know her in a little more depth, it might have felt more natural and less like a switch was being flipped (you're incredibly talented!  But nobody likes you!  But you can fight off shark demons!  But you'll never be good at anything!).  It felt to me like she was a proactive character often being forced into a passive role, and I found that incredibly frustrating - even her character arc of learning to take responsibility for herself and owning her own power was curtailed by a plot that, by necessity, was making her a glorified barter token.  (Related side note:  I get that gods don't care about human rights and all that, but I found Cat's consistently being threatened with sexual harassment/violence slightly distasteful, especially given that she was in a position to do so little about it - it felt like a cheap way to raise the stakes.)  Fortunately the aforementioned character arc seems to have taken her past much of that insecurity, so I'm hoping that'll be less of a problem in the next book.That sounds like a lot of issues, and it is, but much can be forgiven for that holy grail of guilty-pleasure reads: compulsive readability.  And in that, ""Wild Card"" delivers in spades.  Wyman's world is an engrossing one, and more than once during the day I found my thoughts wandering back to it; the only reason I didn't devour it all in one night is that I was trying to read critically as well as just for fun.  This is a very promising start to a series; I will absolutely read the next one, and can say without a doubt that I would even if I didn't know the author.",3

His werewolf lover of twenty years has left him for a female, he's become the new lover of a master vampire, his father wants him back in Hell permanently, and his brothers give new meaning to the term sibling rivalry!This is a character driven story that gives a unique and slightly hilarious twist to the idea of having a bad day. The plot flows smoothly from point to point without annoying jumps, and the characters are likeable. The sex is steamy and hot without being smarmy, and the action is skillfully blended with enough angst to produce a entertaining tale.

When he is approached to use his former military training and is coerced into leading a team on a domestic terrorist mission, he goes through with the mission only to find out that all along his team was never supposed to survive. Now he vows to bring all the ones responsible to justice one way or another.I wasn't impressed by the main character in the beginning, he seemed pompous and annoying, but when it came down to it and he was knocked off his high horse he turned into a highly exciting character. Then you have the relationship between Lou and his wife though it seems tenuous at first as he is indeed keeping secrets from her and she believes that he is cheating on her as he has done it in the past, but as the novel goes on the relationship takes a turn and I found myself really enjoying it. Lou and Mag end up having a much stronger connection than you would think and though Lou is the main character it reminds me of the saying, ""Behind every great man is an even greater woman.""

The heroine had to speak the truth to the hero even when he did not want to hear it. That was refreshing. I have grown a bit tired heroines' who have more issues then broke down blues singers.  The hero has the issues, granted they were easily solved with some personal insight but perhaps he could not see the forest for the trees so it took her to show him the solution.  This is erotica and I am certainly no prude but the sexual verbiage was over done in my opinion. Less is more with that sort of thing authors so please take note!  I would have like to have seen more of a love connection with these two rather then just hot sex. Without the investment in developing the love connection between the two characters the sex just does not resonate with me and frankly become a mite icky in my opinion.

I felt that they had a good chemistry and I enjoyed the buildup of the sexual tension. Ms. Fox sure knows how to write a steamy love scene too which I love. The story was fast pace which made their relationship felt a bit rushed, but not overly where it felt unrealistic. I thought that they made a good pair together.Overall, I enjoyed reading A Lick of Flame right up to the end. One only complaint of mine is that I felt the ending ended a little too abruptly.

I was so hoping that her skills as a doctor would help him, but she appears to be just laughing it off and enjoying his chest pounding and random screaming fits if another man so much as blinks at her.I feel like, she would be more willing to help him through that part of himself rather then see how many times they can get the hump on, while in Cali. Although, hot, for me its not proving love to me. I love Avery as a character, I think she is level headed, and realistically charmed by this dude. I would be also--when I was 17 - 20 years old though lolAs a whole the series isn't terrible. Where characters in other books display possessive behavior towards their women, they don't get as shouty and angry as Xander does. They approach it in a way where any rational male that is in love would.I know that this series is pretty much written. Based on the revelation in this series, I can't help but feel she should either say, &#34;BUBYE!&#34; or offer to actually help him through his issues with anger and work the relationship out.

There are an annoying number of typos, words left out, extra words put in ( maybe left in after editing? ) and these errors drove my OCD nuts!

B00B29JX60,A3TARVYSAZIN27,"02 27, 2013",Todd Russell,Reads like a steroids-infused abstract painting. Stylistically enjoyable.,"One of the more unconventional tales of the DarkFuse novellas I've read so far. More lyrical and poetic in style and substance, which, when I saw the author also writes poetry, makes sense. It opens with an artist painting, followed by scenes of war and warped verisimilitude. What made this interesting was that I had just finished a novel that stylistically was the polar opposite of this story, I was craving some sort of unique voice. This author has a unique voice. I like that.Upon reflection, however, the problem I have with FEVERED HILLS is that there was too little meat in the story department. Instead, my reading experience was like floating in clouds, receiving almost random pieces of story to process. It simply left too much to the reader's imagination. What is The Fever exactly? Why did they want him to throw all his belongings off the cliff? Cannibalism...because?Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this simply because it tried to tell a story in an abstract way (major creative points for the effort), but I'd only recommend to friends who enjoy more esoteric pieces. Sort of like a philosophical Mad Libs novella. It does have some fairly graphic scenes and tries to horrify. I remain hopeful the author's novel coming out this summer (2013) is more controlled, less vague and yet somehow can maintain the intriguing voice displayed herein. 987 Kindle locations.",3

As a U.S. Army Delta he is as tough as they come. ""Never give up"", is the mantra they live by and Hooch is no exception to that rule. Beginning with his capture and torture you believe that nothing can break him, nothing can tame him. Yet, Hooch craves to be broken.""You look like someone who eats nails on toast for breakfast and burps fire,"" she replied cheerfully, ""but appearances are deceiving, I'm told.""Matthew Donahue is ""quite something."" Confident and secure in who he is and what he wants, his life seems very controlled and uncomplicated. His role compared to Hooch's seems, on the surface, to be one of easy going lover but it's the strength of his character that is the biggest surprise in this book. I absolutely love Matt and he feels like the perfect match for Hooch but the question is, is that enough?They sat close together, almost touching but not quite, a synonym for their relationship.I was delighted to see Dan McFadyen, from Special Forces, show up in this book. While I found his advice to Matt and Hooch delightful, uplifting and encouraging, his voice just didn't sound right to me.THE STORYThe book begins with a lengthy prologue taken word for word from the epic series, Special Forces, Marquesate/Vashtan. The prologue is completely relevant to this story and I feel it should be read whether or not you just finished Special Forces. It puts the reader in the right mind set for what is to come. It is very powerful, and possibly the best writing in the book.While Matt lives his life out of the closet, Hooch must live within the protocol of DADT (Don't Ask, Don't Tell). It seems that this would be the biggest barrier to their successful relationship but, oh no, it's not. Hooch's masochistic needs are the challenge to be mastered. I really enjoyed seeing this aspect play out (literally) and was surprised by the intelligence and creativity that Matt showed in meeting and indeed, mastering this challenge.""that was a remarkable exercise in discretion.""Late in the book there is a hint of an 'incident' from Hooch's past that, while important, it just felt like it came out of nowhere. Almost like the authors decided late that they needed some solid explanation for Hooch's behavior. The problem with that is it just didn't have any roots. No earlier hints or suggestions, so it just felt disconnected. The funny thing is, for me, I didn't feel like I needed an explanation for his behavior. I had already accepted that Hooch was just the way he was. It wasn't exactly contrived, just rather unnecessary.THE WRITINGI hate to do this, but I don't think there is any way one could read Special Forces and not compare this book with it. That being said, Special Forces, for me, was all about the writing; the intensity and beauty, the highs and lows, the gut wrenching emotional journey. This book just didn't reach those levels of powerful writing, at all. The flow was fine, the story was good, the characters, excellent but for someone who just had higher expectations, this left me a little disappointed. I also have to note the absolutely atrocious editing. Not only were there extensive typo's, there were dropped words and what I felt were complete sentences out of order. It was very distracting and I find it quite a shame. This, ultimately, is why I can not give this book 4 stars.Hooch huffed softly.

I hated that the moments between Dorothy and Hawk were few and far between, then, when they get their happily ever after, it's abruptly over and the epilogue is not even about them, it is a setup for Undying. After everything Dorothy has been through, she deserved more, a book dedicated to her romance.I cried like an idiot in many parts especially in the clubhouse when Hawk was saying goodbye, can't say more than that. Hawk is amazing and a wonderful man. Despite what ZZ has done, we should not forget his love for Danny, how he brought her out of her sorrow and how she mistreated him. ZZ deserves his HEA.

Fortunately, they were few and far between.  So, I read happily until I neared the end.  That's when a scene so outlandish took place that it knocked my five star to a three star review.

One of my biggest pet peeves is poor editing, but the errors are few enough in number that I did not feel frustrated.Overall: If you are the type of reader that enjoys strange and bizarre tales from time to time, then I recommend this short, perplexing, and odd read. If you are not one to suspend reality for a bit than this may not be for you. Personally, I enjoyed it, but in terms of the overall reading experience and writing style, I rate it 3 stars. It's a good short for a lazy read before bed or during a short break at work. It's not the best short story I've read, but it did entertain.",3
B0070ORZGG,A1WT4DB4V9MW11,"11 24, 2012",Merin,A decent historical read,"THE SECRET OF RAVELSTON tells the story of Jane Freemont, a free-thinking woman growing up in early 19th-century England, where being free-thinking isn't exactly smiled upon. After accidentally embarrassing a lady of status, she's sent to Ravelston, a town to the far north of the country, to live with her uncle, who is the town rector. While there, she becomes aware of a missing servant girl named Mary, and takes it upon herself to figure out where Mary went, and what happened to her.The story had an intriguing premise, so when I was contacted by the author I immediately accepted it. And, for the most part, I did enjoy the book. While it did take me a very long time to finish, that wasn't necessarily the book's fault, and more my own inability to carve out the necessary time each day to get it finished in a more timely manner. That being said, there were some things that slowed the book down, namely the language used; I'm guessing it was true to the time period, but it was still a bit tedious to read all the ""my Lord""s and ""my dear uncle""s, etc. There were also a few slip-ups where the language was more modern (a serving maid referring to her male companion as her ""boyfriend""), which tended to throw me out of the story. That being said, I found Jane to be a very feisty main character, and I enjoyed reading from her perspective. She is definitely a girl who was born in the wrong time period; she's too aware of her surroundings, too curious, and too persistant. It actually causes Jane quite a lot of trouble while she's in Ravelston, but it was those moments that were the most interesting to read.I have a soft spot for historical books, and enjoyed reading about Ravelston Castle, and the beautiful grounds surrounding it. What I didn't necessarily like was the Lord of Ravelston, Andrew, who was too bitingly sarcastic and mean-spirited. I didn't like his treatment of the people his mother asked to visit, particularly his cousin, Carla. I think we were supposed to find him mysterious and intriguing, but I just found him irritating and arrogant. Some of the constant ""this is how the upperclass live"" parts were a bit slow, though, and made the book drag. I think some of it could have been cut out to keep the book at a more lively pace. I also have to admit that I had most of the mystery figured out well before Jane discovered the truth, although I was surprised at one particular twist.All in all, Jane is a plucky, lively heroine who does what she feels is right, and doesn't bow down to society's norms. The mystery, while a tad obvious for me personally, was a decent way to drive the plot and keep the reader interested, and I enjoyed the ways Jane set about trying to figure out what happened. The Secret of Ravelston is an overall good read, and would be a good choice for those of you who enjoy historical tales.~A copy of this book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.~",3

In this, the first volume of a (???) volume set, a rebel bunch of ex-Roman (oops, Arcadian) soldiers have deserted and made camp in what seems to be Germany just after the Ice Age started retreating. Their native foes are a mash up of Germans, Danes and Gauls.The hardly bunch are building their numbers and resources to mount their rebel attack on Rome (oops, Arcadia). The story's protagonist seems to be about 15 years old and in the military somewhat reluctantly (and a poor fit) simply due to his dad being a rebel general in that army.The book wanders around somewhat disjointedly adding a few episodic vignettes which don't seem to either flesh the book out or add to anything. This includes the opening chapter which takes place in the Senate and at a senator's house which doesn't have anything to do with the main story. Another out of place chapter has something to do with a drug addled Greek priest.At about the forty percent mark of this short novel or novella, the book finds its focus as the protagonist sets off on a journey he doesn't understand. That is the theme here. The main character seems to have no clue as to the various office politics swirling around him so he stumbles from one situation to the next like Mr Magoo in a theme park.The fantasy aspect never seems to get going. The action is all talk or sword play. At one point, the good guys are camped at a cursed place with men in black supposedly all around the abandoned city but nothing happens. The good guys camp and then leave no worse for wear.A nice short and, once you are in to it, an enjoyable read.",3

I would be at the lakeat noon if it was the last thing I did.MY REVIEW:This book was a struggle initially for me as I was trying to get into the story. I didn&#8217;t necessarily get the OMG I can&#8217;t put this book down, but I did find myself still reading as there were questions in my head that needed to be answered from the beginning. The biggest one was &#8220;Where the hell are they going?&#8221; lol I know this question seems insignificant, but if you decided to read this novel, you will understand why that was my question. There were points in the book where i wished the author would have spent more time giving details or laying the foundation. Some of the book felt really rushed as though there wasn&#8217;t enough time to talk about what was happening and I believe it was because of that notion that someone how I felt cheated as if important points in the story were missing. Lots of the events that happened in the novel all happened so quickly whereas it reduced the probability of the readers truly engaging and enjoying the journey. Overall the story was a decent read and some what easy to follow, and ending was surprisingly better than the beginning of the book. I did enjoy the characters in the story including the bad ones&#8230;lol. They had a sort of camaraderie that really help transport the book and made it what it was. Though Lark had my attention, I really liked Khea&#8217;s  character. I must say, despite the fact that I did struggle reading this book in the beginning, as I continued to read things became more of an element of surprise.  Remember my question that initially kept me reading?  The author did have a way of making me feel like one of the characters in which I had to take the journey to the school with them, with absolutely no idea of what was going on or what to expect. If you like fantasy then this is a good book to read.",3

The last chapter or two though, it seemed as if the author stopped trying.  Luckily, it was a short book and I was able to finish it.I was a little disappointed that Pearl never changed in the story, more than a couple claw-lengthening type changes when she was upset.  Plus, I was extrememly disappointed in a VET and a self-professed animal lover's irresponsible pet ownership.  I mean, come on, neither apparently believed in training their dogs, and it never occured to either of them to spay and neuter the two of them before throwing them together at Pearl's house?  The inevitable result of THAT bright idea (or lack thereof) and the fact that the author really seems to have no real idea about dogs, (Labradoodles are NOT a breed, they're mutts, and therefore you really can't make generalizations about their traits, and now not only are you adding more mutts to an overpopulated world, you are breeding a dog with a bite history...UGH!) is what knocked this book from a four-star to a three-star for me.  I tend to lean towards write-what-you-know, and if you don't know about it, leave it out of the book school of thought.Also, this book does contain a little bit of anal play.  I'm not a fan of fingers-in-rear-ends, but fortunately it was only a sentence or two in a couple scenes and easy to skip over, if it's not your thing either.I haven't decided if I will be purchasing any other books in the series or not.

Joachim,"This is the first book in a new series call the Manhattan Dinner Club by new to me author Jean C. Joachim. I saw this book on Netgalley and thought it sounded interesting. I don't personally have a pug, but my sister-in-law does and I know they are cute inquisitive creatures, so I requested it.The book starts off with Rory Sampson walking her dog in Central Park.  She is almost knocked down by a bicyclist, and ends up bruised and shaken but mainly okay, after diving out of its path.  When a good samaritan gives her a snapshot of the biker who almost hit her, I thought this might be the Dr. Roberts in blurb.  Nope, just a set up to apparently show how rude the bikers are in the area. Then Rory does a bit of drooling on the nice gentleman who stopped, and she is busy being attracted and telling herself to stay loyal to her boyfriend.  Okay, I get that this turns out to be a foreshadowing of how she really isn't committed to him, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.Next Rory meets the members of what will become the series namesake, the Manhattan Dinner Club;  4 other women pug owners who get start getting together once a week to eat and discuss their pugs and their lives. The other 4 women seem very nice, but I did wish that they had a larger role in the book than they did.We finally meet Dr. Hack Roberts in chapter 3 when he crashes into Rory, breaking both her arm and her pug's leg.  Luckily he is a veterinarian and offers to see to her dog while she goes to the hospital to be treated. At first Dr. Hack is an ass.  I mean a seriously unlikable ass. And I am not liking Rory all that much either. Here I am reading a book about 2 characters that I don't particularly like.  Yet the storyline itself was interesting enough that I kept reading wanting to know what was going to happen next.I will be honest and say that I never really warmed up to Rory. I just couldn't connect with her and spent much of the book wanting to smack her upside the head and get her a cranial rectal inversion.  Hack on the other hand ended up redeeming himself with me. Overall, I gave this book 3 stars and look forward to the next book in the series.",3

This book holds much of that great magic Danielle weaves, but unfortunately lacked some of the passion we are accustomed to seen in the Royal series.I think the story line was great, but the interaction between both main characters was constantly strained leaving me feeling frustrated and as if the story did not quite end making the ending feel short and anti climatic!.. Mattias' character was such as powerful, passionate and sensual individual that his role in this book left me wanting. I just feel that the stubbornness displayed during the story between Mattias and Alannah could have at least been played up a little more with more attraction and action between the two. Instead of the constant fighting and standoff scenes between the two.This new series still has the capability of capturing my heart but with this book I did not feel Mattias story was conclusive nor did he get his full happily ever after I was expecting for him.

Not a good sign. I remember chuckling at parts, but I never really felt invested in the story. Most of the time when I'm reading a book, especially a good book, I feel almost a hunger to finish it. This has led to many a night going to sleep at 3 a.m. when I have to be up at 6 for work. Not so with this. I enjoyed it. I honestly did. But when compared to the Nice Girls series, the Naked Werewolf series, or And One Last Thing, I was just left disappointed.I liked Bonnie and I liked Will. Maybe that was the problem, I just liked them. With the best Romance books I tend to fall in love, just a bit, with the hero. And I get majorly invested in the heroine. I need to see how the story ends. I need to see the happily ever after.I didn't feel that with this book.I enjoyed it while I read it, and if it was any other author I'd probably say, &#34;Well done.&#34; But with a Molly Harper book I just expected better.* I received this book for free from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.",3

Not only does she have to deal with the drama of making a major move to Scotland, she also discovers that her father has hidden a great deal of information concerning her heritage from her. Once Rach meets Brios, the revelations concerning magic and shape shifters come very quickly. Rach has an incredible amount of information forced on her all at once. At first, Rach is very reluctant to accept the truth about the shape shifters. However, I thought her resistance felt forced. So much in fact that it was really quite comical when Rach tries to convince herself that she is &#8220;dreaming.&#8221; Though I found Rach&#8217;s reactions entertaining, at a certain point, her actions failed to feel realistic, especially when the truth was literally staring her in the face.Rach is very easy to like. She&#8217;s a smart girl with a bit of an attitude who isn&#8217;t about to let anyone push her around. Once Rach fully accepts her gifts, I have no doubt that she is going to be a very powerful leader within the Shalean society.I also really enjoyed Rach&#8217;s budding relationship with Brios. It was clear from the moment they met that they had a strong connection. However, Rach is only fifteen and she knows she is much too young to be making a serious commitment. I admire Brios&#8217; restraint and resolve to take things slowly. He never tries to force anything on her and lets her make her own choices. I truly believe they will be a very powerful team, and I look forward to watching the development of their relationship.I feel that the conflicts in this tale were resolved much too quickly. There are a lot of interesting things going on in this story that I wish had been explored in greater depth. The ending felt rushed to me, especially the part where Rach was told about her history and the fate of her mother. I realize that Rach and Brios were in a difficult situation at the time, but I truly feel that Rach deserves much more than she was given. I hope she has the time to explore her past and new abilities in future installments of this series.Over all, I enjoyed reading Discovered. The world Ms. Lilley has created is interesting and I found the concept of the Shaleans thought provoking. I certainly look forward to following the adventures of Rach and her friends in the next book.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews",3
B007L7N26E,A1WZEK2YNPJ7BB,"11 27, 2012",Leapin' Literary Lurkers,Rooting for the good guys means wading through typos,"To enjoy the story fully my initial advice would be: DO NOT READ THE SYNOPSIS!As many of the other reviewers indicate, this author needs to be introduced to the proper use of an apostrophe. The weird substitution of periods (I.d, we.ll, let.s) does indeed distract, but I will not belabor the point.What got to me were the typos and other peculiarities.I am not familiar with how conversion to Kindle affects formatting, but it was annoying to see the following:1. Almost every page had the title bar somewhere in the middle of the page with sentences broken up around it.2. Sentences then shifted down a line part way through.3. Words which one usually sees as one word were split or hyphenated so you'd see things like re-new, tight rope, heavy weight, pre-occupied etc.4. Plain old typos with dropped letters: ""I you want"" instead of ""If""; misused words ""stand-bye,"" ""feel myself loosing it,"" ""Pit it in glove compartment,"" ""was going to off sick""; ""better to error on the side of...""; ""allusive"" for ""elusive""; ""perspective"" for ""prospective,"" etc.5. Misplaced order of clauses (my favorite was she was found ""partially clad in a small field."")OK...now that I've vented enough about typos, I will say that I finished the book and felt the author did a good job of letting the reader get to know the main characters, Mia and Joe. I saw them as very human and appreciated Joe's occasional fling with dry humor. I also appreciated the respectful tone that the Mr. Rennie took toward the several older women characters and the homeless men.I will happily pick up another book in the series.I mildly disagree with the reader who said the bloody scenes were well presented...some of the gruesome aspects made my stomach churn, and I skipped over a number of paragraphs.Hopefully the author periodically checks the reviews and get a heads up on the crying need for better editing. It would shoot the books up to a four or even five star rating for me with adequate proofreading.",3

Libby, the children's author, is broke and finds the perfect opportunity to earn some good money while still able to write her story by being a nanny for Adrian. A very slow relationship starts between these characters. Both wanting to make sure they were doing what's best for Kate.This is a very light read, most &#34;issues&#34; that arise are anticlimactic and quickly solved. Each character has their own personalities, although some were not so realistic and definitely not stereotypical. Our rocker was not a parting womanizer. He was a Texas boy, although some of the dialogue was not very &#34;Texan&#34; or American for that matter; I had to take a double take on some of the wording but it didn't take away from the story. Libby was cute, although one broken heart made her put up her guard. I never really got a feel for why her heart was broken in the first place, never heard anything about the ex that should have made her fall in love in the first place.I liked the story and found it a nice change from the hardcore bad boy rocker novels that are out.*ARC copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*",3

The problem was, the moment she did, she moved away to the big city, leaving him behind. Plus, it doesn't help matters that he works for her father, or that he's not exactly a gentleman in the bedroom. Tyson likes his kink, and he's not so sure Lexie can handle that side of him. When Lexie returns home after graduating, Tyson retreats, but when his friend bets him he can't land Lexie, declaring that if he fails, it's open season on the young woman, Tyson has no choice but to take the offer. Little does he know, Lexie has been pining away for him for years.This started off strong and ended pretty flat for me. Tyson was a great character with a great voice. I instantly liked him. I don't think Lexie came off quite as endearing. At any rate, the hint of a history between them was enough to drive the story forward, but when it came down to Lexie, apparently still a virgin, her eagerness to accept him and the tales of debauchery she's heard about town (apparently he's warmed just about every bed available!)she isn't the least bit leery or turned off. Quite the opposite actually. Tyson's bedroom kink turned out to be nothing more than a threat to bind her, and when the proverbial crap hit the fan and Lexie uncovered the bet, it all just flopped.This is the way I see it: The author had a solid story, for the most part, and then she hit a wall where she decided it could go two ways, drag it out or end it quick. Granted, this is supposed to be a short story, but it would have benefited from a little more information before it was cleaved off in a rush to resolve it. It was literally, ""You bet you could get me into your bed? I never want to see you again!"" Lexie runs off, Tyson decides to let her have her space. Fast forward to an unknown date where Lexie is apparently manning a contest. Tyson approaches her, and after a few choice words, demands she tell him she loves him, and old woman tells her she should, and she does and they live happily ever after.

After receiving a note directing him to a remote house in a small town, Jake seeks his own answers and a way to protect the secretive woman he meets along the way.I enjoyed Endless Night, it was a fairly quick read. I really liked Jake Grogan, he was a man searching for a missing part of his life. He wasn't immature or running from his life, he was in the right place to meet someone and find out where he really came from. He handled Megan's anxiety and fear well. I enjoyed his character quite a bit.On the other hand, I wasn't the biggest Megan fan, especially at first. She had been through a lot, she had every reason to fear. Her character fell into a prison of fear and anxiety, and she gave her life to that fear. It was sad to see, but as the book progressed, Meg began to see these things, and she grew stronger. She had a tendency to be a bit selfish, or come across as cold, but she warmed up, and really helped Jake when he needed it.My overall feelings on Endless Night, it was a good, quick read.

In this book, however, they were particularly bad and made reading it difficult.  There is a desperate need for an editor to help with this story, if the desire is to continue on with a series.The storytelling is very stilted.  The H/h have an insta-love and not enough of an exploration as to how they came to fall in love, which made believing in the instant attraction impossible for me.  One moment they are having a ONS (virginal 25 y.o. suddenly felt like giving it up to a stranger, no matter how hot he is is stretching the bounds of believability), the next they are making blanket statements about the amazingness of their night together with no development.  For a moment, I thought there would be scenes where they ran into each other around town, as a way to play out the fallout of this ONS.  Instead, their next encounter happens very quickly with no build-up.  And then it became all about ""he/she is the one.""  I barely knew the characters, and hence, I really didn't believe they knew anything about each other.To compound the problem, I would have expected a more stream-of-consciousness dialogue, however it comes off as much more stiff and stilted.  There's discrepancies in the storyline that take you out of the story and make your mind drift as you try to read, or at least it did to me.The Bottom LineDefinitely inspired by the rash of contemporary biker/military romances, this is a blend of both.  I happen to like military romances and biker romances, so I thought this would be right up my alley.  It just proves how hard it is to be a writer.  And the importance of a good editor to help with the process.Even if you have a good premise, it's all in the translation to the page, and this book simply falls short.",3

If you enjoy authors like Stormy Glenn, Lynn Hagen, Toni Griffin and Stormy Glenn then you will probably enjoy this book.  It is a cute paranormal M/M romance.Kane Matthews was kicked out of his pack for being gay.  He was always told that gay wolves will never be gifted with a mate by the Fates.  When Kane left his pack he formed a new one with other wolves that were kicked out because they were gay.  Kane is the alpha of the pack and the group own and work at a custum auto shop.The book begins with Kane going into the local diner.  He and his pack have been busy at the shop so he hasn't been there in a while, but as soon as he enters he knows there is another wolf there.  He also smells something that begins to drive his wolf crazy.  It takes another pack member coming in and realizing what Kane smells is his mate.  Kane is excited at the prospect of having a mate, but when he meets the other wolf, he realizes he needs to tread lightly because his mate looks ready to flee.Shawn has been on the run for over 10 years.  His pack has been trying to kill him ever since they realized he was Other on top of wolf.  He realizes Kane is his mate, but is fearful to belong to another pack.Once Kane realizes someone is out to kill his mate, he doesn&#8217;t waste time and claims Shawn.  Since Kane&#8217;s pack is made up of individuals who were kicked out because they were different, the members readily accept Shawn and his other gifts.  The rest of the book is Kane and Shawn solidifying their relationship and confronting the individual out to kill Shawn.Overall it was a fun, easy read.  Yes, the author uses a lot of terms that are not typically used in the US, even though the book takes place in the US.  If that sort of thing bothers you, you will have a hard time with this book.  It was easy for me to overlook that.  What makes the book for me are the characters.  Both Kane and Shawn are alpha males and the author did a great job showing that.  Neither one is more dominating than the other.  Also, the other members of the pack are great.  I will definitely buy the other books to read their stories.If you are looking for a light and easy paranormal romance, then this is a nice choice.",3

Two broken people - one very broken - finding happiness together and getting a happy ending. It was a really good read and I enjoyed it.In the beginning, Maisie is very withdrawn and Ryan wants to help draw her out of that shell. She is a very sweet young woman and he is a genuinely nice guy. It's great when Maisie does finally start to relax around him. Watching their relationship grown and develop left me with a feel good feeling.There was an interesting twist along the way with Ryan's. It showed what a strong, caring man Ryan really was and I'm glad it wrapped up like it did. That same twist really helped Maisie open up and grow. It was nice to see her slowly but surely making progress in opening herself up to a future with Ryan. Later, there was a moment when Maisie tells Ryan fully about her past and herself, I really like how it all played out and how Ryan just loved her and accepted her.I thought there was a nice pace in the beginning but then it slowed a bit in the middle for me. Certain spots towards the end felt rushed, like it jumped from one part to the next without a transition.This story is very much a contemporary romance and I enjoyed it. I felt invested and was thrilled that they got their happily ever after. Overall I felt this was a sweet and loving story.

I had hoped that it would give some additional insight into one of the characters (specifically Rose). The Seeds of Wither, at 77 pages includes content from the first book Wither which I always find awkward considering the reader that is purchasing the novella has already read the novel. It also included a small excerpt from Fever, which at the time hadn&#8217;t been released and made a little more sense. Though for me, I&#8217;d already read it the novel and didn&#8217;t seem worth the purchase.The new novella, &#8216;The First Bride&#8217; Short Story as titled in the contents, is about Rose. From the first page they are married with Rose a mere eleven years old. It continues to just briefly touch on their first kiss, burying their child and then focuses more on Rose&#8217;s decline in health. Rose tells Linden that he must remarry and let it be a muse &#8211; someone that will encourage him to draw again. Of the 77 pages, 13 was &#8216;The First Bride&#8217;. Not much for new content if you&#8217;ve finished the series.Included in The Seeds of Wither was also a map of the wives floor. Included on the final page was a link to the Fever Cover Reveal (behind the scenes video of the cover shoot) and the book trailer for Wither. I&#8217;m not sure if either of those videos are available to readers that haven&#8217;t purchased The Seeds of Wither.All in all, I rated the entire book The Seeds of Wither three stars based on content. The good it came with: a new novella, a mere 16% of the book (and a rehash of information we already knew about Rose), the wives map and two exclusive videos. For the date of its release, it included an excerpt of Fever which was highly anticipated by readers.

That teenage first love, the one you obsess over during class and race to meet in the halls. The one who makes high school more bearable.The one who breaks your heart.The one who finds a way to show up, just as you have put yourself back together.Liz is just that girl. She's a freshman in college, and she rejoices over having gotten over the loss of her first love. Zach left her, moving to a different state, and, worse, he stopped calling. Just like that. She has a new boyfriend, a best friend who is on her side, and a family who loves her. Who needs Zach?Well, she gets the answer to that when he shows up on her college campus.This is predictable YA lit, but fun predictable. Liz is a fairly faithful rendering of a college freshman who wants to think she has her life together, but who is only fooling herself. We know she's settling for the current boyfriend, and we know where her heart lies. But Zach crushed her, and surely he can't expect to show back up as if nothing happened, right?Zach is more than a one dimensional YA love interest. He has his own struggles, although we never quite come to understand why he behaved as he did. His apparent dumping of Liz is only tacitly explained, and doesn't make much sense once we get to know him. Still, though, we do understand why he still cares for Liz, and we also understand his frustration.The overwrought crisis that pulls the two together is almost comically hyperbolic, but by that point, you just want Liz to realize what the rest of us have known for 200 pages: she belongs with Zach, and he's there, waiting for her.As an unrepentant lover of YA novels, I did enjoy this one. Yes, it's predictable, but it's fun. And Zach is super cute.Thanks to NetGalley for the preview.Published on cupcake's book cupboard@VivaAmaRisata",3

Granted, in this day and age of the internet, young girls can learn a great deal without experiencing it firsthand.

I did not realize that this was a serial until I got it, but then found that I could also get the full book which I did appreciate. If I were only reading it as a serial, I am not sure that it would make me anxiously await the next part. I did not feel the intensity of Jessica and Dane at the first of this book, but am hoping for good things for the rest of it.  It is a classic story of a young girl looking for a job when she had a one night stand with someone who turns to be the boss of the company that hires her.  We see from the first part that this will be somewhat of a D/S story but will need to see more to get a sense of whether it actually has much chemistry.Now as a full book, this may be a pretty good story.  I am only giving the first part of this book 3 stars, because it didn't leave me salivating and waiting for the next part.  Having said that, I will read the next parts and give this the benefit of a slow start.",3

The reader will quickly encounter a less than pleasant home environment that Ashley lived in and the decisions she makes leaving home looking for a better life. While her mother wants her to marry Neal, she meets Brandon and thinks he's the one for her. Soon Ashley's hopes and dreams fade as Author Billy McCoy takes the reader further into Ashley's life, seeing both the good as well as the bad. Ashley had a dream for her life but will she be able to succeed and fulfill that lifelong dream? That is a question that can be found as the reader continues along this journey with Ashley.There is a second story found within the book; &#34;Online Dating: a Memoir&#34;.  I didn't personally enjoy this portion of the book quiet as much. This story takes the reader along the path of Billy Mccoy's journey as he travels abroad to boarding school and later worked as a movie critic. Billy reveals the story of these deal ladies whom he loved yet passed away. He shares about their influence both good and bad upon his life. One day upon answering the door he finds those who have come to share the love of Jesus. Upon sitting down with these visitors there is a lively discussion that unfolds. later in life as Billy continues his daily agenda he recognized that there were changes that he must make and finally came to the understanding; &#34;God, I don't have all the answers, but let your will be done.&#34; The writer takes the reader along the journey of two different people, yet for me personally I didn't find the writing to be as engaging and stimulating as I had hoped. I hope the writer will continue to craft their skill and develop new stories, developing new plots and readings that will pull the reader deep within the story.",3

B00BR4M1XW,A17ETBG254GGV2,"04 13, 2013",Rhubarb,Trail of Bones,"I loved this book, even though I am way past being a Young Adult. It's a pleasure to read a book with a substantial plot, engaging characters, and good setting. I particularly liked the way the author handled the change of POV each time, including a phrase or two to make it clear immediately where and who was involved.Another strong point is the author's ability to give each character his own voice and personality. As the story drew to a close, each actor remained true to his characterization, even while changing and growing as an individual, and as the group grew to become a community, a team. The ending was a bit weak--I would have preferred a sense of victorious closure before the teaser for the next book.For me, the fight scenes dragged, but that may just reflect my own tastes in such matters. The backstory portions were, for the most part, concise enough (though I thought the description of The Shale would never end). At one point a character is re-introduced from a couple of hundred pages back--it would have been nice to have included an apposite phrase to remind the reader who this is.I really wanted to give this book 4 stars (3 being average, 4 for above average, 5 for a classic). Chris Salisbury is a gifted author, head and shoulders above the usual self-published hacks. However, he is in desperate need of an editor, someone who can rein in the errant commas, catch the breaks in continuity, complete the broken sentences, and correct the misused words (e.g., `shutter' for `shudder'). If Amazon allowed 3.5 stars, that's what I would give Trail of Bones. It's a shame to write so well and then be downgraded for terrible editing (or lack thereof).I feel strongly that books for Young Readers in particular should be shining examples of literate writing.I liked Trail of Bones, and I will read the sequel.",3
B0095BOU5G,AZK3DSDDXN81C,"11 17, 2012",Mom of 3 Voracious Readers,"I like it, but...","This is a tough review for me. I really love a good dystopian read, so I'm always delighted to read anything like that. This dystopian series has a number of scenes that are too similar to other existing series. I don't like that. It still needs more proofreading and revision. The bottom line is that I read the first two for free and kept purchasing the rest of the episodes for book 1 and book 2...so I liked them! I want to read more, but I wish the author would make more effort to steer clear of anything that smacks of a Hunger Games/Twilight/Uglies remix. The series will stand well without that.The author includes a disclaimer of sorts at the beginning of the novel that states that basically, young people dying for entertainment value isn't a new concept, and even Hunger Games had similar themes that came before it. True. I've read those other books (and more) and was very entertained by them. The ""I Am Alive"" series has some new twists and elements that would keep it fairly fresh, but then it pulls in scenes that feel like they are replicated from another YA series (Hunger Games, Twilight, Uglies) and it's just not necessary.President Snow, er, I mean Prophet Xitler, shouldn't have lips that are mysteriously too red, like from blood. We don't need to see manipulated ""made for TV"" kisses or sedatives to keep someone safe in the games. I guess a love triangle is a love triangle is a love triangle, but boy this feels familiar! The Leo/Peetah/Edward vs. the Woo/Gale/Jacob characters need a little more individuality. Decca seems to be going for the Woo/Gale/Jacob instead of the Leo mix, and that shouldn't bother fans, but I was periodically slammed with references that made Woo and Leo too trite. Team Woo and Team Leo just don't have the right ring to them, anyway.I sort of feel like I did all this in Hunger Games (do the game, become victorious at game, uh-oh...back in the game and repeat, while at the same time--work on a revolution) and I'm sort of pulled back to the Uglies a lot, too.  But there are some other story lines that are referenced that make me intrigued and I want to know more. I want to hear more about the rest of the world, the Burning Man and the underground cache. Is the rabbit hole some kind of reference to a Watership Down type theme? Could there be some other original survivors underground? I'm hoping future episodes will be fresh and won't continue to repeat what we've already experienced or won't just remind us of one of those other popular series.I will be purchasing the next episode.",3

I actually came across this book on Goodreads and saw how many positive reviews there were for it. While I'm not known for reading romances very often, I decided to make an exception for this one. And I'm so glad I did!It was a very cute, heartwarming story. It took me no time at all to read, and I immediately liked the main characters, Carson, his daughter Eloise, and Eloise's dance instructor, Penny. I rooted throughout the entire book for Carson and Penny to find their way to each other. I just felt like they needed to find their way together--they seemed to be really good for one another. They complemented each other in ways that were so sweet and romantic. Right before Christmas was a perfect time of year to read a cozy feel good book like this one.The only problem I had and the reason I didn't give a rating of four or five stars was the way in which the deceased wife was villainized, in my opinion, especially by Penny. I lost my mom when I was young, and so I felt this aspect of the book hit close to home for me. Carson's wife died three years ago, and Penny couldn't understand why Carson still had pictures of her up in his house. It seemed appropriate to me, especially because Eloise is only four years old, and she needs to remember that she had a mom who loved her and to know what her mom looked like since she was so young at the time of her mother's death.Penny worried that Carson still loved his wife and was stuck in the past, not wanting to move on with his life. Penny had never been married or had any kids, plus she is pretty young, so she wouldn't understand what it's like to grieve over a spouse. I get that Penny was wondering if she had a chance with Carson and didn't want to fall for him if he wasn't ready to begin dating, but I disagree with the way the author went about this. Carson's daughter didn't even get to know her mother, and Carson, to me, was honoring her mother's memory. I actually felt hurt at times--it just hit a little too close to my own life.I still really enjoyed this read, and I agree with the positive reviews. This was a really sweet book with characters I liked and cared about, and I'm glad I decided to see what all the fuss was about. :)",3

The ideas of the book seemed a jumble between Aladdin or the Prince and the Pauper and Casper (the movie). I wasn't sure if I wanted to like the main character or hate him, mostly because I wasn't certain what was going on in his life or his mind. There are times when the book just assumes you know something, sometimes it will even say ""everyone knew what that meant"" instead of telling the readers what it meant. So readers are left wondering why they're in the dark about something everyone knows. When I started this book I felt like I had come in on the end of a series, not the beginning of one. And there are typos, contrary to the author's insisting that what people are calling typos are actually British-English spellings, there are grammar and spelling issues in the copy I was given that have nothing to do with British-English. I would know the difference, I married someone who is from the UK, after 10 years of life together, I know my way around.The plot WAS unique in some ways. I found the idea of calculating the amount of icefire magic stuff refreshing, instead of the usual people who run around books, brandishing balls of flame or bolts of lightning without a thought to size, shape or catastrophe it may cause if overdone. More could have been done to develop the idea of this icefire stuff in the minds of the reader. The eagle army was interesting, as was the society around them.

Returning home is a turning point for Landry has the chance to own up to his mistakes, and to make amends with his family especially with his father.I initially wasn&#8217;t too sure about Landry because as at he came across as a jerk, was cocky, a player, and he made some silly choices, however, by the end of the story I did like him. I loved Mila Eby is Landry&#8217;s roommate she was a really sweet sassy down to earth sort of girl, who was always true to herself.Mila has always had feelings for Landry, but somehow he is clueless to this. Landry has never really seen her as anything more that a good friend, and his cute nerdy roommate until one night when everything changes. I loved the friendship that Landry and Mila have, and the relationship that developed between the two it was sweet, passionate, and sexy. Mila was definitely what Landry needed.I like the storyline told from Landry&#8217;s POV. I must admit that after reading the synopsis I had a different impression in my head of how the story was going to go. So I can&#8217;t really say much about it without giving away spoilers, I will say was a fun easy read low on the angst about love, family, friendship, and forgiveness.Overall I liked this book; I would have liked more about how Landry makes amend with his father, I feel this aspect of the storyline could have been developed more. But that being said I liked the writing style of both authors, and the flow of the story.

My eyelashes are so thick that they look like the ads for mascara where the fine print says that false lashes were used.  I have to curl them so they don't mark my glasses.  I also take 8,000mg a day of organic extra virgin coconut oil that says medium chain fatty acids as long chain is for cooking.  For the first time in my life, I have no acne and my skin looks amazing.  There are many other benefits I could tell about but then this would be a book.I give the author 4 stars for the recipes and 2 stars for poor editing, grammar, wrong tense usages and reversed words.  Maybe English is a second language?  That's how this reads.

It was a far better than I expected, and much better than your typical romance.  I knew how it had to end, and yet it kept me on the edge of my seat.  The characters are so well-written that I fell in love with them, and I caught myself crying on 2 or 3 occasions.You're probably wondering why I'm giving it only 3 stars then.  Well, the simple answer is that the author needs a good editor.  The grammatical errors drove me nuts and I almost stopped reading after the first few pages because of those errors.  A writer should know the difference between its and it's.  She should know when to use I versus me.  And she should understand the correct usage of clich&eacute;s if she's going to use them.  For example:  every time the main female character used bad language, someone would tell her not to use that language because &#34;it was above her.&#34;  NO-NO-NO!  The language isn't above her.  She's above using language like that.  The language is below her.  That's just one of many mistakes I found that drove me nuts.With all of that said, though, I really loved the book and I would definitely try another by this same author.

It is a contemporary romance that promises laughs, tears and heartache. The question is, did it deliver?I liked the storyline to Kiss Me in Paris. I thought the prose was good, the story interesting, the dialogue believable. However, I think the book tried a little too hard--especially in the humor department.One romcom mishap is funny, three in as many chapters is starting to get contrived. However, after the initial few chapters it did concentrate more on the romance and story and less on trying to get laughs out of the readers.The story of Winter and Cade is interesting and you are rooting for them. After all, who doesn't love a sexy cowboy with family issues?During the twist of the story I felt like Winter acted a bit out of character in feeling sorry for herself more than being understanding, but that's just my personal take.This book has me so torn between the good writing, story and characters but sometimes contrived scenes and out-of-character actions as well as the ending felt a little... Disney--where all your dreams come true. haha.I guess in the end I have to ask myself, did I enjoy this book? Yes, I did. Will I read book two? Yes, I will.

The rhythm of reading, of the language flow, seems to move in cycles from riveting and focused to uncertain and unengaging.Many incidences in the novel are fascinating such as Nihal's  trial to be judged as worthy to learn magic. Even so that event seems to be a thinly veiled ecological appreciation of the expanse and joining of all things of creation. However, this meditative quality that Nihal experiences is strongly portrayed.Juxtaposed against this is the picture of lands after being conquered by the tyrant. Lands bellowing smoke and strange things, noise and loud music bursting from taverns. No space for silence, peace and the healing of the green spaces. I kept thing of Blake's poetry and his rail against the pervasive effects of the Industrial Revolution, 'those dark satanic mills.'Despite this I enjoyed the major characters. The story of Nihal and her trials to become a knight, Sennar and his magic, and Ido who wants Nihal to channel the energy of her anger in her fighting, to become 'a genuine individual who would be good to herself and the Overworld.'Despite some of the challenges with the flow of the writing, overall I really appreciated the storyline and the developing character of Nihal as she faces her own fears and ghosts from the past, as she begins to mature. I look forward to the next episode.A NetGalley ARC",3

Naomi is a lively and charming woman who recently broke up with her boyfriend. Ryan has always been in love with her but he preferred to back up when Naomi starts dating his friend Sam, the classic arrogant and self-confident guy to whom every woman is instantly attracted.When Naomi and Sam split up because of his infidelity and his behaviour, Ryan finally has the chance to prove how much they are meant for each other and the occasion arises unexpectedly and strangely.I enjoyed both the characters, especially Ryan. He is a perfect mix of masculinity, sweetness, kindness, gallantry and passion. Naomi, on the other hand, never convinced me completely. I liked some of her aspects, for example, her impulsiveness and her insecurity, but I think she hasn't been defined very well in all her characteristics. She definitely is less catching than Ryan.Having said that, this short story is an interesting and passionate reading. The interactions between the two main characters are hot, sweet and catching. Ryan's fierce attraction and strong feelings towards Naomi are palpable and I think this last aspect is the real IF YOU WANT ME strong point.Reviewed by Maria Cristinafor TheRomanceReviews.com",3

Writing a novella, one draws a fine line between not enough character information or too much because it has to move quickly. I didn't think there was a lot of depth to them. Declarations happen quickly, few lines of drama, and quick love scenes.

I'm also a sucker for any story that has animals involved, especially when it comes to puppies or kittens. As a self-published book, I was impressed because Kim's writing has an endearing quality to it.Sarah Churchill can barely makes end meet. As a former foster child, she has major trust issues, and  feels unloved and unworthy. While riding her bike, she hits a stray puppy. She takes the puppy to the local vet even though she won't be able to pay for any of the bills. There she meets the very kind and handsome, doctor Grant Morrison who allows Sarah to pay off the bill by working for him. Grant isn't sure what to think of Sarah because she seems a bit ditzy and not at all comfortable around people. Plus, she doesn't have room in her life for a dog. But Grant is able to convince her to take in the stray, which she names Rocky, after her dream man, Rocky Balboa.Rocky is a handful and drives Sarah crazy, but Grant helps Sarah, to her surprise. Soon Grant and Sarah become good friends. Sarah is falling in love with Grant but she can't allow her feelings to get anymore involved than they are because of her criminal past. Grant has this idea that Sarah is wholesome and everything innocent and good, but his nosy aunt and sister thinks Sarah is using him. Grant doesn't care and  slowly courts her so she'll never think of leaving him even when the going gets really tough.Healing Hearts was a pleasant story and Sarah and Grant have great chemistry. This is more of a G-rated romance teens would enjoy as well. There's a lot of animal love here, including the adorable antics of Rocky that brings Sarah and Grant together. If you're a fan of the heroine who has had a rough life and finds love with the honorable and handsome hero, I would give this one a try.Katiebabs",3

Everything is hearts and roses until one fateful Christmas Eve night when a tragic car accident claims the life of their 6 month old daughter.Greyson needs Stefan's strength, love and attention but Stefan withdrawals and shuts her out completely.

Everyone around her worshipped her but her general behavior and attitude left me feeling that she was nothing but a self centered, cheating, lying bitch who only cared about herself.

I have a weakness for the Guardian/Ward historical romance novels so decided to purchase this one and become familiar with this writer.In this story, Lord Michael Durham's deceased father had suffered from a case of assumed madness.  Of course in those days, little was known about the mind and the causes that led one to have mental issues.  Therefore, it was widely held that the offspring of these folks, were also susceptible to what was often termed madness.  Although many people in society were aware of Durham's father's issues, he had been dead for some years, so little was made of it.  For Michael, he enjoyed his country home, didn't care much for the London Season and had decided he would never marry lest the same issues which befell his father came upon him.Then, the lovely Elizabeth entered into his well ordered and well thought out life.  He didn't want this ward foisted upon him but it seemed the guardianship of Elizabeth was part and parcel of everything else he inherited from his uncle including his title.  For Elizabeth's part, she was accustomed to running her cousin's estate, had a small dowry and when her cousin's wife pushed her out, the thought foremost in her mind was to persuade her guardian to allow her to spend her dowry on a small estate in the country that she could call her own.  Accustomed to wearing breeches and taking care of the land, entering London Society was quite a chore for Elizabeth.From the moment Michael met his ward, hoyden though she was, he was more than interested in her and found it difficult to hold to his earnest intentions to never court a woman with the intention of marriage.  Even though he was tasked with the job of finding suitable candidates for a potential husband for Elizabeth, he did promise her that if she couldn't agree on a candidate, he would help her purchase a small estate.  Of course, Elizabeth fell hard for Michael but he was warm and then cool, warm and then cool, hot and then cold, because he couldn't bring himself to put her in the position of having to nurse him if madness should descend.  He withheld his reasons for his cool behavior and this brought some angst into the storyline.  It actually became a bit much.  When villains descend with intentions to harm Elizabeth, Michael has to make some hard decisions.  But, he comes through like a champ.",3

I love reading how people adjust and survive, what they improvise, how they get along, or don't.  This is not that.  This book starts with an unbelievable tragedy, although I was expecting something worldwide,  Then we're catapulted into the future and whatever happened after 'the tragedy' is left to our imagination. Next, the character is approached by a strange man who whisks her away from everything, the man she loves, the family she adopted as her own, her friends, everything, for the chance to avenge the tragedy. She's put into 'the bat cave' where she receives remarkable abilities that help turn her into her very own superhero.  She can run faster than a speeding bullet, climb the tallest mountain, bend steel in her bare hands.  Pardon me, my attempt at cynicism.  Meanwhile, we go back and forth to the ones she left behind, all the torment and questions with no way to find answers.  I didn't find this to be dystopian, we didn't experience the tragedy, it was just there.  With the new found abilities, the bat cave, and the angst, I'd call this more of a fantasy.

B00HD16MFG,AUF0OPKICU6D4,"01 9, 2014",Sadie Forsythe,ok,"This was alright I guess. Nothing stood out and dazzled me, but I didn't hate it either. It just didn't feel like it knew what kind of book it wanted to be. Did it want to be a gritty, dark werewolf tale, a light hearted HEA, baby on the way romance, a pseudo fairytale (complete with Prince Charming and kissed frog references...not to mention the Big Bad Wolf), or a piece of heady erotica? It appears to have tried to be all of the above and fell pretty flat as a result. It would have been much stronger, I think, if it had been a little more selective.It starts out with a fairly pointless affair and some middling sex. I wouldn't really mind if it tied into the plot in any way, but it didn't. So I was left feeling like the actual story didn't start until about 15% in and the plot that the reader thought the book was going to be about was dropped almost completely. As was the whole &#34;twin without&#34; aspect, as set up in the blurb and first couple pages. It played almost not part in the book. It was all just a little jarring.Then, once the reader crosses that divide they're faced with a hero who was rightly angry about his predicament but able to forgive his assailant in mere moments. Wait, what? I was left behind it moved so fast. The insta-love kinda had the same effect on me. As did the mysteriously experienced virgin who was up for going all night, with no discomfort and a shockingly expansive sexual repertoire. Guess she learns fast, right?Thrown in amongst all of this was a disturbing number of cuddles, I love yous, gentle kisses, stroke the bellies, have your baby, etc. All of the happy domesticity just felt out of place amongst the bloody werewolf battles.The writing itself wasn't bad and I don't remember many editorial foul ups. So, it's a perfectly readable book. And the right reader just might love it. I thought it felt a bit disconjointed for my liking. I do have to commend it, however, on being classy enough to mostly avoid the whole sexually abused heroine trope even when provided the opportunity. I only mention this because it's become so common in recent publications and it was nice to see a heroine not have to play that particular victim role. Again, not a bad book, just didn't do it for me.",3

Simplistic writing, but does keep you interested until the end.Speaking of the end now....The entire book is about this guy...the killer.  The thing is, the end is a big let down.  Too simple and it was much too easy.The killer was portrayed as clever, crafty and very intelligent with unlimited resources.  The agent knocks him on the head a couple of times with a rock and he's dead and story over?I was disappointed with how this ended.  It's tough when you have build-up throughout a book but the ending comes very swiftly and then abruptly ends.  Over.Oh well.If I had to guess, Id say this was self-edited.  I HOPE it was self edited, because a pro would not have missed the problems in this book.The author states the Casanova Killer slit his victims throats from right to left, but then during another killing, the agents mention his M.O. as slitting the throats from left to right.The next time?  The writer goes back to right to left again.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Pick one and stick with it.  Family and friends WON'T catch stuff like this.  You're a good writer.  Get your books professionally edited.There were so many commas, that there would be enough left over for another two or three books.  She describes the killer as having ""longish, black, hair"".There are zero commas during all of that my dear.  ""longish black hair"" would only have a comma after hair, if there's another descriptive word following that.  This happened quite often.Many, many sentences missing words.Had this been edited properly, I would have given a higher rating.  This gal can write, so it's too bad, there were so many mistakes.

However, at the first sign of trouble he caves in and believes the worst of Naya, the woman of his dreams.  What a let down!  Then you are lead to believe he is this big bad warrior, but he doesn't even act like a tough warrior that will fight for the love of his life.  Wimpy, wimpy!  He acts like he has been mistreated and abused. Really!  Then after the heroin (Naya) is called horrible names, accused of leading Menace and everyone on, being a terrorist, stripped of everything along with being shot......she acts like the world along with Menace hasn't done anything wrong.  Really!  I couldn't even believe Menace was truly big and bad enough to beat Terror up after letting Terror and his team just walk all over him.  I believe Terror probably just gave in to Menace and let him beat him up in order to appease everyone.  Even Vicious turned out to be a wimp.

I don't think it portrays the charachters in the right light either.The book drew me in from the first chapter.  Ariana and Theo were such great characters and as their story unfolded you could not help but feel for them.

Within a matter of hours, virginal Mary rocks the headboard with scarred veteran John (and those scars aren't just on the surface, you know ...) and finds herself wildly attracted to man whore Max.Part II of the saga picks up moments after Part I ends, and our Mary has unleashed her inner sex tigress. She craves John - and he her. They have some rockin' sex together, but as much as she cares for him, she can't quell her attraction to Max. Given the opportunity to bed him, Mary finds herself powerless to say no. How does this go over with John? You might be surprised.As Mary discovers her sexuality, she continues to learn tidbits about her mother, and the sex shop continues to be the object of vandalism and violence. Mary falls deeper into an emotional (certainly sexual) relationship with John, yet she fights fear over her business.Again, we have a mildly entertaining premise peppered with some hot sex.

Unfortunately, the complete lack of any sort of explanation combined with the way the latter half turns into one big ridiculous chase/over-the-top silly ""action movie"" sequence complete with disappointing non-ending really cheapens what was an otherwise excellent premise with an interesting protagonist. There needed to be greater buildup, less heavy weaponry and explosions, and more tension beyond ""this is a bridge, it's kind of making this guy feel weird, which is creepy, I guess"".

Permanent Lines by Ashley Wilcox,"3.5 out of 5 starsPermanent Lines is the story of Merrick Drake and Amelia Driscoll.  A brief but intense encounter between the two leaves Merrick in a state of emotional turmoil he&#8217;s never encountered before.  When he finally manages to find Amelia again he never could have imagined the lengths they would have to go to to be together - but love is worth everything ... right?I&#8217;ll be honest, I really didn&#8217;t warm to Merrick.  He kept telling me he wasn&#8217;t one of those pansy guys who pined after a girl he&#8217;d only met once, and yet that is what he did pretty much for the entire book.  I really would have loved a Prologue that showed more of his &#8216;pre Amelia&#8217; persona so that there was some validity to his claims that he was acting out of character.  I might have been able to accept his almost obsessive behaviour a little easier then (and I acknowledge there is a disclaimer on Goodreads from Merrick owning his &#8220;pussy&#8221; behaviour at the start of the book - his character still didn&#8217;t work for me).  I should say this was my first Ashley Wilcox book and I understand that Merrick gets his introduction in the Forever Series.  Perhaps I would have got the background to his character I was seeking if I&#8217;d read that first.  Having said that, this book can be read as a stand alone.The relationship between Merrick and Amelia was a little bit &#8216;insta-love&#8217; although the timeframes meant that it wasn&#8217;t instant - things between them moved very quickly off the back of one weekend.  Having said that, there was a clear connection between the two and seeing a &#8216;tough&#8217; guy shaken up by love to the extent that Merrick was, was very entertaining.The story was intense and I quite enjoyed watching the plot unfold.  There were some elements that were a little hard to buy at times, but overall it was an easy to read, well written story.Visit the Into the Night Reviews blog or Facebook page for great book reviews, new release updates, giveaways and more!!",3

He&#8217;s not a nuclear physicist saving the world, he&#8217;s an art dealer.  The Hero has apparently also never heard of sending a woman flowers, perfume, more underwear to replace the thongs he&#8217;s stolen or anything else as he is gone for a second week in a row and the new couple, who have slept together like three times, are no longer communicating.  For a Hero who initially wanted the Heroine to be &#8220;addicted&#8221; to him, suddenly as a reader you are aware that - I think it&#8217;s significant that suddenly I can&#8217;t remember the Heroine&#8217;s name - she isn&#8217;t addicted and wanting a fix, she&#8217;s relieved he&#8217;s gone; so am I as the reader &#8211; two other men are ready and willing to take our widow on a date and possibly won&#8217;t be playing mind games with her.  I have to say that I honestly felt hurt for Ryann that the same man who pursued her immediately and aggressively, having gotten sex from her, finds himself too busy to call her &#8211; again, ouch!I don&#8217;t think this is what the author wanted her readers to feel.  The problem, honestly, is that the author didn&#8217;t take the time to develop the relationship between Jeremy and Ryann &#8211; no one is going to believe that after one date to a French restaurant these two people are so in love that it is heart-wrenching and all-consuming. Ryann has found herself sexually and since Jeremy has gone rather cold on her, I as the reader want her to try out some other cuisine that might be more palatable!From other reviews from the initial release, it looks like the author has done some editing to improve the book.

Determined to speak with her and get an explanation, he offers up his experience as a Master to do a demonstration at the BDSM club that Anna is a receptionist for. After all is said and done, Anna moves back in with Caden, despite her fears and reservations about being his sub.A year later, she leaves once again. Not for good, but to straighten herself out. She has some things about her she needs to figure out, and she&#8217;s bound (no pun intended) and determined to do it. Will she be able to put her demons to rest and return to Cade and be his sub?Okay. That&#8217;s all this book was. The story line was good: a sub that doesn&#8217;t like many aspects of being a sub. I enjoy these BDSM romances, they&#8217;re some of my favorites. But I felt this book was misleading.For this being a longer romance, I expected there to be many hot, kinky, BDSM erotic scenes. There were two, and they weren&#8217;t anything to really get excited about. Raven McAllen would lead up to several moments where I thought there would be an explosive sex scene, and there just wasn&#8217;t. It was very disappointing. I expected more from this.I am also very frustrated that I had to use the dictionary app on my Kindle quite a bit. Raven used many big words that you would rarely ever use in conversation. They were used in the right way, at least, and according to my Kindle&#8217;s dictionary. I was very frustrated though, that I am a word person, I know how to spell, pronounce, and use many words, but a lot of the words she used I had no clue even existed. This genre and time period doesn&#8217;t call for big words such as &#8220;genuflecting&#8221; or &#8220;paracetamol.&#8221;This book could have also used a run through with an editor. There were missing words and often times the wrong name was used, confusing the heck out of me.Overall, this book receives three stars from me. I hate giving low ratings, but there were too many things that drove me crazy while reading this. Now, I don&#8217;t want to sound mean, at all, and if I did, then I am deeply sorry, because that was not my intention.There is another novel after this, following the story of a good friend of Anna&#8217;s, Athol.

To me, erotica should be closer to psychological suspense than romance, but hey - this is why I'm not a writer; just a reader.Maybe it's the short form, but the story's length (or lack thereof) means there's not nearly enough conflict or character development. Caleb has more depth than Ishari, though - she's more a symbolic dream woman rather than a true character.Australian romance writers seem to be on a successful rock-star hero kick as of late - see works by Lexxie Couper and Jess Dee. THE FINAL WISH goes along with this trend, but Tracey O'Hara makes the fictional band's success more believable by having it as the result of a Djinn granting a wish. Unfortunately, this tactic is used to solve the major problem of Caleb's self-destructive brother. That pat ending was just too much, and further proof why I believe epilogues should be scrapped.Tracey O'Hara's best work is her Dark Brethren series. THE FINAL WISH just seems flat in comparison.",3

Perhaps the author was trying for an avant-garde approach, but I feel that trailering different characters' quotes end to end without paragraph indents seriously harms the read.  You end up with huge blocks of text and your perception of POV (Point Of View) can easily get confused. In short, it makes reading this story a challenge, and that is a shame.  This could easily have been a 4 Star review, and even a 5 with a few editing fixes as well..... This is a dark, chilling, and disturbing read that leaves you thinking.  It has an edgy story line that I won't reveal here (unlike one of the other reviewers who gives altogether too much away).  Fair warning; It goes places that some readers might find distasteful, but there is a REASON for that. Given the nature of short stories, you don't usually find character interactions this involved, but it pays off at the end.  What you have here is the raw version of just the kind of writing that wins critical acclaim from serious literati.  I think a few fixes in format and editing could make3:53 a.m.a story that people remember and talk about.  I hope the author makes those fixes, this story deserves them.

Be prepared to have your senses overwhelmed and your brain exploded into the realm of astral bodies, ghosts, lucid dreaming and a large number of other New Age themes.Along with this 'enlightenment' comes the the darkness of Dahlia's past and present. Her emotionally abusive, manipulating and neglectful alcoholic mother, Dahlia's complex reactions to the absence of her father, and the ever present shrink that she uses like a crutch, all add to the complexity of the story.Much like a kaleidoscope, Kaleidoscope World had many different pieces that shifted and fit in together, and then with a slight movement, they'd shift and fit in a different way. I liked how that seemed to occur throughout the book, but it also made it feel a little disjointed.I didn't really like Dahlia, I couldn't stand her mother, and I didn't really love or hate Javier. The one character I actually liked was Felipe, yet I felt he was under developed and underutilised. This left me feeling a little lost as to why I kept reading. If I didn't like most of the characters, why would I want to know what happens to them?I quite enjoyed the way Tomica writes, the way she paints pictures was very clear and often came about in the most amazing way. Poetic comes to mind. I enjoyed the picturesque visions Tomica painted of the scenery and Dahlia's surrounds (including the other senses outside of vision) at times it felt like I was actually there with Dahlia in the bustling streets, the serene island or as the sun broke over the streets of Barcelona.I made a couple of notes about the disjointed feelings as I went, one instance of a weird jump was at around 20% through when Dahlia found herself in one scene only to be whisked to another on the next line with no indication of a change. This also occurred at the end of the book - 95-100%.These could be addressed by some additional formatting in the eReader documents to allow the reader to see a break. This would help with the disjointed but smooshed together feel of some of the scene changes.There was one typo I picked up at 69% - '...would thinks (think) they're not.'**Note: I was provided with an electronic copy of this book in return for an honest review**",3

Sometimes it's like stepping through a curtain and into another world; sometimes it's jumping through a time portal; sometimes it's catching glimpses of the others through the shadows. ""Identified"" takes it a step further with a different race of people including the hybrids of unions between this race of beings and humans. These hybrids are known as shifters and because of their unique heritage of half-onyx and half-human, they can move between the two worlds. Maya Price is a shifter, although she doesn't know it until the night of the high school graduation party when the hunters come to find her.The story is rich, the characters interesting, the plot fascinating. The flow of action is broken by excerpts from interrogations, journal entries, deep thoughts from the future from different characters. This gives added depth to the story, helping you to understand a little bit more about each character, a little bit more about the story line. While the pace isn't as fast as other books, it certainly is a compelling read.

B00D8GLHYG,A139TFJC84TT4D,"03 25, 2014",C. Jefferson,The charming story of a WWII Navy romance...,"From the moment Daniel first saw Jacob on the deck of the &lt;i>Gageway&lt;/i>, he was drawn to him.  There was something about the young man that caught his attention and when the two of them finally connected, it's not surprising that the attraction is mutual.  But in the U.S. Navy during World Ware II, being gay is misunderstood and certainly not tolerated.  In a world that isn't going to make it easy, can Daniel and Jacob build a relationship that will survive - not to mention surviving the enemy planes and the bombs and the guns?Overall, I liked this one.  Daniel and Jacob's interactions are great, and I really feel like the reader can get a good sense of what life would have been like for a couple like them during the span of time portrayed in the story.  (The only real detractor for me were a few occasional bathroom-related thoughts by Daniel that left me making a face - they just didn't seem to be necessary in the story.  Nothing overly inappropriate, though.)",3

B005DZ4FJE,A3OYLMW1KPOW38,"08 27, 2012","Desmond M Hassing ""Des""","This might be a good intro to a novel, but it doesn't work well on it's own","Despite the fact that ""Gifted Apprentice"" is written in a style that I myself do not find appealing I believe it has potential.  The book just doesn't go deep enough into world building for me, it lacks the descriptive elements I appreciate when reading fantasy in favor of a brisk understated mentality which often leaves the reader without necessary information, a good example of this are the ""sylph"" a character class seemingly created by the author who have blue skin, a language of interpreted ear twitches not unlike cats and who form a rare class of apparently indentured servants on the main character Sallis's home island. That along with their ability to sense and inherent dislike of the use of ""The Gift"" represent the bulk of what we learn about this race of people, one of whom is a significant part of this first story. The sense of mystery that this creates may be enough for some readers, but for me I needed more too really get into and enjoy the story.In addition this first volume has no internal conflict, which to me makes for a story which lacks intensity, there are some vague discussions of sorcerers and people who seek to corrupt those with ""The Gift"", but no one like that is featured in this story. In the end a conflict is hinted at, but not enough time is given over to it to truly begin heightening tension in the story.Still I don't feel like I wasted my time reading this story and I do feel these first 90 or so pages would make an acceptable beginning to a larger work(Novel), but presented here without that conflict which I feel any good story needs I felt like I was reading simply for the sake of reading and not because I was emotionally invested in the characters.",3

B004Y89RKI,A346Q7G40L4LNK,"08 28, 2012",Paul A. Mastin,Mixed bag of Sweet's writing,"If you picked up Leonard Sweet's Real Church in a Social Network World thinking you'd get some great insights on church life and cyber connectedness, you quickly find you were mistaken.  This book has some good ideas.  But it doesn't work well as a book, and doesn't fulfill the expectations created by the title.  Basically what Leonard Sweet (or, more likely, his publisher) has done is repackage excerpts from some of his other books, and include a ""bonus chapter"" from his newest book, Viral: How Social Networking is Poised to Ignite Revival.Leonard Sweet has had his finger of the pulse of American Christianity for a long time, and I respect his insights, if not completely his theology and perspectives.  For example, Sweet bemoans the intellectualization of Christianity, which detracts from relationship with God and others.  ""One of the problems of the church is its forceful insistence on intellectual adherence to certain beliefs, in the relative absence of a holy passion for the incarnational practice of those same beliefs.""  Are conservative Christians more concerned with defending the Bible than with obeying it?  The defense of orthodoxy detracts from relationship to our peril.  ""We are disconnected from our Source so that we have become sterile.  We may be doctrinally correct, but we have become spiritual cadavers.""  Challenging words, indeed, but they leave me wondering if Sweet does have lines beyond which he will not wander theologically.The excerpt from Viral is most relevant to the title of this book.  He describes the ""TGIF culture"" (Twitter, Google, iPhone, Facebook), and contrasts the Googlers (who embrace TGIF culture) and the Gutenbergers (for whom the written word is normative).  Sweet's take is a bit mixed.  A self-described native Gutenberger, he embraces the TGIF culture, yet sees its shortfalls.  ""Much of human contact has been reduced to acronyms, misspelled words, emoticons, missing punctuation, and mindless replies to meaningless revelations. . . .  These things pass for conversation, a thing that used to thread the fabric of society.""So my recommendation, if you want to hear more from Sweet, is to skip this e-book and peruse some of his other titles.Thanks to Waterbrook Multnomah for the complimentary electronic review copy.",3

B003I84MRS,A328S9RN3U5M68,"07 8, 2010",Grady Harp,Poetry: A Matter of Opinion,"Veronica Camille Tinto, born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago but now living in Texas,  has published her first book A JOURNEY INTO TOMORROW and informs the reader in a very tender way that 'Writing these poems began as a therapeutic process which turned into words that supported me during a very tumultuous period in my life.'  Books such as this, presented with a beautiful cover of a sunset over water, plead credence, and while the thoughts on the pages of this collection are touching, if somewhat nave, they are truly short meditations and not poems.  The term 'poem' is defined as '1) A verbal composition designed to convey experiences, ideas, or emotions in a vivid and imaginative way, characterized by the use of language chosen for its sound and suggestive power and by the use of literary techniques such as meter, metaphor, and rhyme. 2) A composition in verse rather than in prose. And 3) A literary composition written with an intensity or beauty of language more characteristic of poetry than of prose.'  Tinto's writing is simply outside these guidelines.An example of Tinto's work follows:READY FOR THE CALLAre we ready for the call?Do we have all out emotional business in order?Do we tell people that mean the most how we feel?Do we say love...show love...and mean love?Then can we truly say hear [sic] I am...it is I...and I am readyfor the callThere is honesty of emotion here and a sharing of life experiences that this diary marks as a woman overcomes the struggles she encounters as well as the discoveries of joy she finds.  And doubtless there will be readers who connect with her brief messages. But even given the broad parameters of how poetry is written today, Tinto's words do not fall into the realm of poetry.  And that is fine.  Is the book worth reading? Yes, any source of solace that is available to people who need to connect with fellow travelers is worthy of publication.  Grady Harp, July 10",3

But when his price is marriage, she's sure that you can't take the whorehouse out of the whore, no matter where she might be living and she's bound to prove it to him.Ms. Waters does a great job portraying the feisty, very unladylike Marion realistically. While you may not like her as well as you would Allison, you can't help but love her progression and growth from bitterness to joy. The only reason I didn't give this on a 4 Star review was because it seemed to lack some of the depth of character that you found in To Bed A Montana Man and because it had a sudden ending.There were times when the back story didn't seem to match the actions of the characters and what you'd come to expect from them. Some of the tension also seemed contrived, eg. The arguments with Jack, another ranch hand, which are never resolved.This story moved along at a great pace but, suddenly, it is over. It felt like hitting a wall while driving 40 MPH. There was no lead up or transitioning warning you that the big ending is coming so it felt a bit anticlimactic.

The next thing she knew, Rachel had somehow hooked up with Jeremy, the geekiest guy in class, for an experiment that would change the look of ""MyFace,"" and connect people in the most serendipitous ways. Old friendships are rekindled and new contacts are formed. The internet is truly the world-wide web, bringing people together from all reaches of the earth.The premise of this story is really appealing; take the good old ""six degrees of separation"" and apply it to our modern, technological world. Using ""MyFace"" (an online social network that sounds very familiar to all of us with computer access), the author shows just how tiny our world really is. One small plan put into action can have a ripple effect, and the characters in this story prove this with their developing relationships. Each character introduced ties in with one or more other characters in an engaging way. Like the internet worm Jeremy creates, the story twists and winds through the lives of six very distinct people.The story started with several pages filled with texting between friends, which really supported the feel of a modern, technological story. This technique wasn't carried through the storyline, however, which made it feel like a loose end. Although I thought the original connections between people were well done to good effect, I felt it began to drag a little towards the middle. It seemed we spent a lot of time with a character or two here and there, and didn't get back to other characters for a while. As a result, I felt it needed just a touch more tightening up. For this type of story, I would have liked to see the characters and their storylines more closely intertwined; relationships inextricably pulled closer together until it was difficult to remember they were ever strangers. At the very least, a culminating event that somehow involved everyone (such as the ending of the movie ""Love Actually"") would have offered a satisfying closure. Without that final connection, the ending felt a little unfinished. Although the author clearly tried to tie up the various storylines, the lack of synchronicity made it seem like some of the stories were left hanging, just waiting to be addressed again. I was surprised when there wasn't another page after the last page.All in all, a really fun and appealing story that kept my interest and made me want to read until the end.

The author took a risky path and managed to keep the plot together.Sadly, while I believe its better than a three star book, I just don't feel that it is worthy of 4 stars.  In the end I found myself calling it just under 3.5 and rounding down.  If half stars were allowed, this would have been easy to rate at 3.5 stars.The story itself was almost Lovecraftian in its complexity and nature.  Saying much more than that might give away too much, but I was definitely impressed with the imagination and thought that went into creating the small universe the main character found himself in.But that allow opened up the story for some flaws.  One is something that Lovecraft himself appeared to understand.  Any story requires that you be able to suspend your disbelief and follow along hte plot.  Lovercraft usually worked around this by having the point of view character be someone that the reader would have an instinctive level of trust with.  Most of his narrative characters were officials or reporters.  IN Catch a Succubus the narrative character is a 17 year old boy who from the beginnning has others pointing out that he's had a history of daydreaming.  He just doesn't quite bring the authoritive view that makes it easy to slide into the story.  THe sad thing is that, the plot requires that he be that age.  It was definitely a challenge for the author, and while he managed it well, it didn't quite sell the story.The other area the story suffered from was in character development.  Many of Lovecraft's stories appeared to have a specific ending he wrote for, and character development was secondary.  Like Lovecraft, the author here seemed to have predetermined the ending, so the whole story flowed down a set path.  Many of the characters don't get much time on the page and appear mostly to help push the main character down the plot path towards the ending.  It's a good and well thought out plot, but I wanted a bit more character.  When the final scene comes, the punch was lacking.This is a very good imaginative writer, who came up with an interesting idea for a plot and managed to write an engaging story.  My complaints should not be taken as condeming the book.  I definitely recommend it to anyone seeking something different.I do warn that on my Kindle Touch there were a few page format issues, where extra line breaks appeared, and for grammar and spelling purists there was a couple of minor issues, but overall the story is well presented.",3

After getting through about 30% of the book I started skipping the 'voices in her head segments' with sister Patrice and her father.Really didn't pay much attention to the usual details such as punctuation, etc. since I was skipping the above referenced parts.There are some things I felt could have been expanded on, in particular what the person in the future's world was like and interweave it into the story.  I didn't care for the weak nature of the primary character.  Someone knocks on the shelter door and she urinates on herself? While safely locked inside?  The crazy thoughts she had and the whole weird spider thing was a tad much.  A woman who loves and is separated from her child will walk through the fires of hell to find the child. She will do whatever it takes and take out anyone who gets in the way.  Except this one.  She spends the majority of the time afraid while in the safety of the shelter.The author has a nice vocabulary, but at times it can get a little flowery.  It appears the woman's 'adventures' become the basis for some form of religion, at least that's the impression I got. Not sure where the author is going in future episodes, but I sincerely hope it's not in the same diary format as this one.",3

However, I was looking for a deeper emotional rollercoaster. I think this may be because I suffer from endometriosis, the same condition the heroine suffers from, and it is the main conflict for her decisions. Being someone with the same condition I understood her need for a child, and the steps she was willing to take to achieve it. I loved how Colton supported her once he realized what she wanted, he was just awesome. But I kept thinking&#8230;I would love to have it as easy as her. Where is the pain that comes with the knowledge of how devastating it is to not be able to conceive? It is also hard emotionally and physically to deal with endometriosis and I did not feel that. I didn&#8217;t feel Colton&#8217;s concern about her condition either. I mean, they never had any serious discussion about what it meant. It was mentioned lightly, even though it was the driving force behind majority of her decisions throughout the book.I was also flummoxed when Colton&#8217;s family had to tighten their belts after one bad investment. Our heroine noted he was a gazzilionare. It is hard for me to believe that he would have invested all of the gazillion of dollars into one scheme. But other than that this story was lovely and I read it in one setting. The pace was good and I never felt bored. I loved how they interacted, the sex was sweet and scorching, a perfect combination.3.5 stars",3

I feel like I've read it 10 times now, but other than that I did enjoy the book. Disclaimer is I read Taut first, then went back and read books 1-3 + Slack. So, that has certainly skewed my perception.A couple of facts: I ADORE FORD!! He is my fave of all the characters. I've never fully embraced Elise or Rook. Elise bc she gave Ronin the Clare ultimatum. My aloofness towards Rook is probably c I read Taut first and know how messed up Ford was over her. In Taut I couldn't understand this connection or unusual possession she had with him since she was so in live with Ronin. Now having read them all I can say I see what the author is shooting for but still don't embrace why Rook went wacko when he left.Slack, does a good job of giving us more insights to where Ford's head is, what his past &#34;relationships&#34; consist of and where his head is at upon the starting of Taut.Did I enjoy it? Yes. Fast paced enjoyable read.Would I recommend it? Yeah, if you liked Ford in the series then definitely.Was it worth the $0.99 I paid? I think so.",3

Far from the average romance, Ruesch's second novel defied my expectations and swept me into a whirlwind of wit, romance and intrigue.I think my favorite aspect of the book is that the romantic storyline doesn't overwhelm the narrative. A lot of writers in this genre lose sight of the story when their characters start coming together, but not Ruesch. Neither Aria nor Adam are solely consumed by their passions. Both have a personal objective driving their actions over the course of the narrative, a fact which greatly appealed to my personal taste in literature.Diehard fans of historic fiction might object to Ruesh's quirky and unconventional leading characters, but I found both Miss Whitney and Mr. Willoughby rather endearing in their way. I admit their values and personalities are probably a little too avant-garde for the period, but it isn't enough to ruin the story and actually leads to some rather delightfully entertaining exchanges.The mystery itself didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, but it included enough twists and turns to sustain my interest. It also retained a fairly steady pace beginning to end, which again, kept me engaged in Aria's adventure.A pleasantly amusing piece, Cloaked in Danger is notable for its clever structure and humorous prose.

You gotta tread carefully, giving the necessary care to the character's condition. I think in this case the author did right by the heroine but unfortunately failed to cue us in. ~ Under the CoversBeing probably one of the last ones to hear about the New Adult genre, I say this book was just okay. The low rating isn't because the book was bad but rather it felt like it wasn't yet completed.The story is told from first person by our heroine who had to deal with some devastating experience. We come into the story after the initial crisis following this experience, but before the full recovery. This gives us time to both discover in bits what exactly happened to her, and to see step by step how and with who she gets over things. Even though I can't say I'm a big fan of first person narration, I have to admit this helps get into a character's head, especially in a plot such as this where psychology is the big chunk of the story.The subject matter of this book is not an easy one to write, I give that much to the author. You gotta tread carefully, giving the necessary care to the character's condition. I think in this case the author did right by the heroine but unfortunately failed to cue us in. Even though for the whole of the book I was inside the heroine's head, I was unable to make a connection to her and I think that's where the book fails. As the most important person in this story, Tabitha makes not much of an impression on me, even though I try hard to sympathize with her concerning her past. And not only Tabitha herself, but also the rest of the characters feel as if they might or might not have existed and it wouldn't matter for me. Her father, who help pick up the pieces together right after her incident is hardly there to make me feel for him. The new best friend Tabitha makes is also supposed to be a big help for her in getting over things but again, her existence is like a shadow. And Noah, the hero of the story, the one who's the biggest support, the biggest step in her recovery, fails to be that big. It felt like everyone had the right amount of potential, and they came so close to make the story reach its climax, and yet, there seems to be no climax in the end.Another problem I had with this book was the unanswered questions. Sure, we do get why she's the way she is, what happened to her and how it affected not just her but everyone around as well, especially her family. But we never get any more detail than the overalls. I felt as if I was an outsider, and it frustrated me not to get any more information concerning the heroine herself and her relationships with those around her, or the hero, who seemed like his story was a bit more than we're told.It was things like these, the little details that were neglected yet if told, they would've made a difference, and the fact that I couldn't connect with any of the characters, that made me rate this book this low. The story had potential, it's a real life problem that I'd be happy to read the heroine get over and move on with her life, but somehow it ended up being short of that potential. I would've preferred to read a hundred more pages if it meant I'd get the full of the story and a chance to click with the characters.*Review Copy provided by author",3
B00EPF5LSW,ABEDCBUFUW1WP,"01 6, 2014",armyofbono,I'm torn,"I'm really torn on how to rate this book. It had a lot of potential, but it just fell short for me. I was really excited to start reading this after suffering from some post book depression after The Hunger Games. I had read a view reviews that said it had a very similar vibe, so I was really hoping for the best here. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver. Rosa, our MC, had so so much potential. I wanted to like her so bad, and to a degree, I did. I loved her spunk. I am all about angry, snarky, and bitter heroines. Up until Rosa met Joseph, I was really starting to get into her character and after that it just died. I know a lot of YA, especially dystopian YA seem to center around some kind of love story. That's fine, I can get behind that...if it's well done. Rosa and Joseph's relationship wasn't. They met, and instead of showing how they fell in love with each other, the author just tells us that they love each other. Instead of seeing, reading the dialog between Rosa and Joseph and seeing how well they click, and mesh and grow together, we're just told that after a couple of days (maybe it was more, the timeline was very confusing)that they feel so strongly about each other.It started to looking up a bit when Rosa left Pau Brasil to go to The Classes. I was hopeful, I loved the character of Rash and the other boys. But you blink, and it was over to move onto another plot. That is generally the whole pacing of this book. Joseph brings up Rosa's father who we hear about briefly and there's so much mystery surrounding him, and then bam, time to move on and forget about what was just said. That's kind of how everything plays out.I hesitate to say that at least the writing itself was good. While it was, somethings were just so hard to understand. There were scenes described that I literally had no idea what was going on, no matter how many times I reread. There's no character development for anyone. Characters feel more like cliche tropes rather than actual people. Rosa and Joseph's dynamic is flat, and boring. I don't feel any chemistry between them what so ever. A lot of their interactions go something like this.Rosa: -says something snarky-Joseph: -smiles, something about gold-Rosa: -continues to be snarky until she finally feels bad and semi-apologizes-Joseph: -accepts her apology and tells her how much he loves her-That's it. I have ZERO sense of who Joseph is. The only reason I have really any idea of who Rosa is because it's told from her narrative but if it weren't for that, I'd have no idea. We learn nothing about Joseph, other than he's made from gold, he's gorgeous, and says all the sweetest things even when Rosa is being a whiny brat. There's nothing wrong with the 'good guy' character (Hello Peeta Mellark!) but being as I know nothing about Joseph, it feels forced and fake.I hate to sound like I am bashing this book, because it's really not TERRIBLE. It just could be so much more. The world that the author describes is interesting and ultimately that is what kept me invested. I wanted to learn more about The Woodlands. I wanted to learn about the different places, the different classes, all the experiments, and the Superiors. But I didn't care about the characters.If you are like me, and don't particularly like cliff hanging endings that seem like a device to buy you the second book, consider yourself warned. The ending served it's purpose. Even though I wasn't in love with the book, upon finishing I immediately bought the second one without thinking. It was only when I was 15 percent into the second one did I realize that maybe I didn't want to continue on with this series. (Heads up to people who are considering the sequel, it ends in a very similar manner)Either way, I'm not really sure how to rate this book. On one hand, there were aspects of it that really interested me. But there were also a lot of things that left me rolling my eyes, too many underdeveloped characters, an all consuming love interest that didn't really make sense, and weird plot devices. Overall, I'd give it a 2.5.",3

B00HND9L66,A1H91CXX9TWOD9,"03 27, 2014",Reading as much as I can,Loved Joe but Alyssa was immature and didn't seem worthy of him,"Plot in 3 sentences: Alyssa has had a string of 'bad' luck; lost her job, boyfriend and is feeling like things just don't go her way. Joe is the business partner of Alyssa's older and super successful brother, and Joe has had a 'thing' for Alyssa since he met her 15 years ago - and she was 15. Alyssa's luck turns around with a great job, great sex, she gets her HEA with Joe (with no cliffhanger).I read this series in a row within a few days of each other. I really enjoyed the story about Alec, but this one fell a little flat for me.Alyssa is 30 years old, but comes off as a 20 year old. She can be whiny, self-indulgent and immature. Not a favorite combination for a strong heroine.Joe is quiet (not sullen), and reticent to share any details about his 'unsavory' past. Which is totally fine. An 'almost' brooding sexy successful man who has turned his life 180 degrees around is incredibly impressive and makes a great male hero. He is protective, loyal, smart and loving. What's not to love?This book is another 'romance light' where it's predictable, easy and no fuss, no mess kinda of romance. There is a villain, but even then, she wasn't that bad. She was almost comical in her failed attempt to bring Alyssa down. Nothing new there.But overall, this book was easy to read, the storyline never got boring, and as I mentioned before, Joe is awesome.What was great about this book?- Joe. Even though he is supposed to be a thoughtful and quiet guy, he does open up to Alyssa's father and eventually to Alyssa. It is heartwarming to see how he worked so hard to turn his life around. He isn't apologetic, but a little embarrassed. Feeling not worthy of other people's admiration and affection and devotion.- Alyssa's parents. The father is a pastor and the mother is just awesome. The father's heart to heart with Joe is so sweet to read. Makes you want a dad like him.- yeah, it was steamy hot at times.- reading about the other characters (Alec and Gabe) and their wives from the other two books. This can be read as a standalone, but it was fun to 'catch up ' on the others as well.- the fashbacks to when they were younger (15 years ago), really cute. Alyssa was outgoing, and confident. Joe was floored by her presence. Very sweet to get a glimpse of it. Appreciated  the flashbacks of his unhappy childhood - it was a huge insight on the adult that he became.- HEA.- No cliffhangerWhat wasn't so great?- Alyssa's character. For a 30 year old, she was a bit flaky. The reason for losing her last job was not 100% her fault. She did handle it badly, but it was not unreasonable. The way she handles her attraction to Joe is juvenile. Instead of being honest or trying to reach out - she flirts and uses her body to drive the heat/chemistry up and push him/goad him into reacting.- (sorry, Alyssa again) - during one of their 'fights', Alyssa is very upset with Joe and what does she do? She runs out to a dance/bar/club and starts to flirt and dance with other men. Ew. Just ew. And immature. That is how she is going to deal with a problem? Joe doesn't deserve that kind of support in his life. When the going gets tough - the tough try to make you jealous? Not good.The book started off strong for me, but the more we got to know Alyssa, the less I liked her.It was not bad, it just prevented me for falling in love with them as a couple. Kept thinking that Joe could do better....",3
B003Z0D2HK,A2EXMLF4RE7GFM,"10 3, 2010",Debra L. Martin,A Good Start!,"I picked up this novella during a free promotion.  I was curious to see how the novella was presented because it is being advertised as an introduction to the novel that will be published in the Spring of 2011.The story opens up with a powerful scene seen through 10-year-old Lucia's eyes.  Her mother has just given birth to a son, but the child is no ordinary child.  This child, Caio, is the long-awaited savior, ""Haissem,"" for the people of Rezzia.  While her father presents the child to the faithful, Lucia is first overjoyed, but when she tries to join them on the balcony, her father pushes her aside and the cold reality of his rejection hits her hard.  Compounding the sting of rejection, Lucia witnesses a terrifying event involving her mother.  When she calls out to her father for help, he continues to ignore her and an event that will change Lucia forever plays out.  In this short scene, the author paints a vivid picture of the turmoil and suffering that Lucia endures - her conflicting feelings for her brother and her heartache over her father's rejection - and I was a little disappointed when the next chapter unfolded 19 years later.The rest of the novella is Caio's story from his ascension to the ""Dux Spiritus"" to his taking over as commander of the Rezzia army in their battle against their mortal enemies, the Pawelons.  We are introduced to his personal guard, Ilario, who secretly loves Lucia, but their difference in class makes a union between them impossible.  This surprised me because there is no back-story to let the reader know this fact so the full impact of their forbidden love is lost.  However, the author unfolds a masterful story of Caio's hopes, dreams and his own inner demons about living up to his own legend and doing the right thing.Mr. Siregar has given us a taste of the epic novel to come with this novella.  If you want to read a talented new author with a flair for storytelling, you should definitely pick up this story. I for one am looking forward to reading the full story when it's published next year.",3

This short story had a very, very interesting cliffhanger to it and it had my interest the minute I read the first page.  A Sexy rock band that turns werewolves....sign me up.  =)I loved this short story that I cannot wait to find out what happens next in Episode Two.  Ty Langston worked it out perfectly for this short story because you are introduced to the characters and you find out what the main problem is for the characters.  And the ending left me in shock and my initial reaction was that's IT....oh heck no!The Genesis Project by Tigris EdenThis was a very different story that I am used to, but it was very enjoyable.  It of course had another cliffhanger, but Tigris did an amazing job explaining everything.  She made sure to talk about what happened to the main character, Genesis, and how she came to be and she introduced other characters as well.  I'm intrigued to find out more about Xander and Adam and how Genesis may have feelings for really.I also loved the concept of the story and what happened to the humans. I normally do not like Sci-Fi books, but Tigris did a bang up job on it.It didn't get my attention until Genesis finally left her father though and when she finally went to the real world.I look forward to the 2nd episode more to this story because I need more of Adam and Xander.The Getaway by Riley RossThis story was not my favorite, but I do want to see what Riley does in the second episode.It mostly was about Juliet and her boyfriend and how they are spending time together on a getaway, but here is the kicker his family is coming and of course something unexpected happens that makes Juliet very uncomfortable as well as her boyfriend.Can I just say, boyfriend's mother already gets on my nerves...GRRR!!I can now understand why Juliet wants to whoop some butt...not only because of her boyfriend's Mom and what she did...but of course her boyfriend is being difficult as well.I'm hoping I like the second episode better for this story.I did like the fact how Juliet was very aggressive and stood up to the trouble that was brewing.I recommend Romantic Tales: Bedtime Stories Episode One to readers who want a perfect book to read right before bed time....but be warned, you may want to read the next episode as well because of the cliffhangers in all three.",3

Right, now that's out of the way, I liked this book. Which is a little strange for me because I didn't really like Nancy Delaney. The tension between the two characters is built and sustained well. There were enough twists to make sure I turned the next page but despite an avid interest I couldn't like Nancy. She was condescending towards her room mate and supposedly best friend. Making snide comments about her room mate never having to work for anything and being supported by her rich family while Nancy has had to work hard for everything. Even in a dangerous situation she takes a moment to insult her best friend's intelligence by stating &#34;only I can get us out alive,&#34; right... Nancy talks to herself and calls the much more courageous/smarter voice her &#34;alter ego&#34; which I found annoying. Why couldn't it just be another part of her rather than an &#34;alternate.&#34; She also gets on her high horse about Peter, grouching he is only using her for sex and yet... treats him like he is only good for sex and influencing people to get what she wants. I'm sorry - who is using who here?The plot left me with a lot of unanswered questions - why was Nancy so important? What is the link between Peter and the Russian guy? What will happen next? (obviously...) The book ends up in a much darker place than it started and takes a while to get going. While I still have issues with the novel it was a gripping read and I am keeping an eye out for the sequel.xxx Literary George",3

The storyline was really good, however there was a little too much 'tell' and not enough 'show'.

I'd also suggest that the information in the book be dolled out in smaller chunks - this could be done in rewrites.Having said all that you'll wonder why I gave it three stars for.

The writing style made it difficult for me to get engrossed in the story, as I kept being pulled out by odd word choices, or in some cases what seemed to be opposite meanings of what made sense.For example: ""He held the phone, an object reeking with disgust, away from his face."" What does that mean? Is he disgusted with the phone? Is an inanimate object somehow feeling disgust? Is the phone suddenly reeking with a foul smell that disgusts him? Something else entirely? When I came across things like that, I'd sit there pondering them for a while, trying to make sense of it before continuing with the story. It was distracting. :(It would have been a DNF fairly early on, but I was curious about the mystery so I skimmed through the rest. I figured the mystery out early enough to think Zane was awfully obtuse, but still found it kind of interesting. I don't think I ever really liked any of the characters, and I'm not sure how much I believed in most of the relationships.

The first couple of chapters were a little bland, but thankfully, I enjoyed INSPIRE ME more than I thought I would. However, there were a couple of things about this novel that I think the author and the publisher probably forgot to warn us about -- but really should have.A) In one scene, Lily and Raine unapologetically participate in the use of illegal recreational drugs. For me, this wasn&#8217;t a deal breaker. I&#8217;ve stumbled on quite a few taboo subjects in the search for fun reading material, and the smoking of pot is nowhere near as offensive as a few of them. For another reader this might not be the case, so it&#8217;s good to let the public know before they spend money on your literature.B) There&#8217;s a random threesom* scene thrown in -- SURPRISE! I know, I was shocked, too. Usually, I&#8217;m warned beforehand. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it was freakin&#8217; hot and I definitely enjoyed it, but, again, probably a good thing to warn someone about before they buy your book.

As the story opens we meet Blaze as she is traveling to the remote lodge she has purchased, apparently sight unseen, and learn that she is 1) quite tall 2) has a very low opinion of herself 3) has recently lost her father 4) discovered she was adopted at the reading of his will 5) has a bachelor's in business.  She arrives at the Lodge, meets Jack, the obnoxious handyman/caretaker she has hired, apparently without checking any references and inspects her property for the first time.  For the next 200-300 pages were are told these same things over and over again.  OK, to be fair we are told a few other things as well, but these five bits of information are repeated many, many times.  About the midpoint of the novel more action takes place, we learn quite a bit more about both Blaze and Jack and the story becomes quite interesting.  The story reaches a great climax but then continues for another fifty to hundred pages.In the introduction the author mentions that she is direct publishing this series and has chosen not to use a professional editor.  I think she might want to re-think that decision.  This is a 581 page novel that really should run about 200 -250 pages.  The same few bits of information are told repeatedly while other aspects are left unexplained.  There are some huge plot holes and, particularly in the last hundred pages or so there is too much plot, almost as if the first half or so of the next novel has been tacked on.I really liked this story, the premise is imaginative, the characters have great potential, the setting is wonderful.  I think that there is a really good story in here, one that has the potential to rivaling the TRUE BLOOD series in story lines.  It would be better though if the novel were trimmed down considerably, cutting out so much of the repetitions, eliminating some of the extraneous plot points, closing some holes in the plot (explaining the hierarchy among the supernatural beings) and some plain inconsistencies (Blaze is supposed to be smart, have a degree in Business but bought a remote lodge, sight unseen without a solid business plan).

This was a sweet and short introduction to The Chase series.Liam Collins has recently moved to the city and anxious to land a job before his savings run out. He is shocked therefore to be given an interview and then given the job at a publishing house. The interview was a little obscure and at the end of it Liam is still unaware what his actual duties will be but the pay is good and he can&#8217;t believe his luck. He is asked to bring the completed contract questionnaire and turn up at an address the next day.The building he finds himself standing outside the next day is not what he was expecting but it wasn&#8217;t until he was shown to an executive apartment that it was made clear to him. He was to be the public face of Chase Preston, the bestselling author.I really like the author&#8217;s writing style and it was easy to embrace the storyline. Liam was a likeable and amenable character and an instant hit. Chase on the other hand was standoffish and antagonised Liam. He acted the elder of the pairing although Liam is a good few years older. Liam found himself attracted to Chase and on the two rare occasions they came into contact,they ended with passionate embraces but then Chase returning to his aloof demeanour.Although I can appreciate this was told from Liam&#8217;s POV the reader doesn&#8217;t really have any insights with Chase and is therefore unable to bond with his character.

Menta, Jr.",I've certainly had worse weekends than the guy in this book,"Search ""erotic stories"" on the Kindle and you will get literally hundreds of results, covering every preference, sub-genre, and price point.  After seeing all that, I had to buy at least one erotic title (okay, I bought a second one a few days later).  Anyway, this is the first of the two books I bought.  It's not a bad deal.  For less than a buck, you get a friendly guy cavorting with three enthusiastic women in some English country house somewhere, with everyone doing everything to everyone else over the course of several days.  For an old book from the British/""By Anonymous"" erotic sub-genre, the prose is bouncy, fast-moving, and the outlook generally upbeat (no mean-spiritness, or bad judgements toward the women for enjoying the sex).  The book is of a decent length, and laid out (no pun intended) nicely for the Kindle, as if someone actually spent time to cleanly convert the text to the digital medium.  Things do get a little repetitive, as the happy male in the story seems to like the same three or four activities over and over, but, heck, I wasn't expecting Tolstoy when I bought this.  If you're open to this sort of thing, I'd say give ""A Weekend Visit"" a try.",3
B008XOA4YW,A3AVRSSNHRMNEI,"10 25, 2012",kimbacaffeinate,tale about All Hallows Eve,"All three books deal with a couple and so the paranormal tale is wrapped in a romance. Each has a crisis to be dealt with and all occur during the twenty-four hours surrounding all Hallows Eve.Jocelyn Drake's Of Monsters and Men deals with The Winter Court's Wild Hunt. The tale is a short As an Asylum short tale and features Trixie, and elf and Gage an ex member of the Winter Court. When a local wolf pack asks for help against the hunt their romantic evening gets turned upside down.  I enjoyed the tale, but it was obvious these characters are from an established series. It did peak my curiosity and kept me entertained.The second tale, The Ghoul Next Door by Terri Garey was my personal favorite. In fact, I actually went searching for a series about the characters, but had no luck. GRR! The tale features a witch and a warlock. Cassie Holloway is the local witch and has been trying to get her families property back from James T. Falco. He refuses to sell it and it belongs to her family. On All Hallows Eve the veil between worlds is thin and she plans to evoke a spell to bring her grandmother forth to help her. The tale that unfolds was action packed, cute, romantic and had me begging for more.The third tale, Trick or Treathen by Caris Roane was by far the spiciest tale and the pages sizzled. The tale features master vampire Treyne of the Prescott Territory in Arizona. In Roane's vampire world, vampires are not a secret and live in communities. Many vampires now share a blood bond with humans and Treyne has been fighting his attraction to Jenna Shawe. Jenna is trying to locate her missing sister and the tale that unfolds is hot, dark and held me captive.Blood by Moonlight is approximately one hundred pages long, but also includes two excerpts; The Forbidden Lady by Kerrelyn Sparks and Turn from Darkness by Jaime Rush.

The latest case she's delving into is a case of SHC or Spontaneous Human Combustion. Yet it doesn't exactly fit the pattern of SHC. As Alyssa is drawn deeper into the case, she's plagued by what she first believes are nightmares.

B0092Y09GK,A3PRH58HD0CGCZ,"10 12, 2012",Amazon Customer,A Case Where Finishing the Story Makes a Difference...,"Originally published as Dakota Dream in 1991, the story begins with a great historical western premise - the (fictional) niece of Custer is found nearly drown by a Lakota warrior who nurses her back to health.  The promising plot fades a bit as he chooses the most predictable method to warm her body - stripping her of her clothing and using his naked body.  Most of the first half of this book continues with the same sort of treatment.  While much of the plot is fresh, even now, it is given a trite twist with poor dialogue and a very unlikable, spoiled character in the heroine, Dominique Dubois.However, the second half of the novel seems to have reawakened the storyteller in the author as not only does Dominique become more likable, even endearing, but she fleshes out a much better, noble hero in Jacob.  The second half of the story definitely makes up for the slow, moving meandering plot in the beginning (which is why I gave it 3 stars).  Unfortunately, many won't make it far enough to enjoy the character development.  Not to mention the often confusing changes in point of view, mid-paragraph, where you are unsure whose eyes you are living through.That said, I have read a few of Ms. Ihle's novels and I know that this is not the best representation of her work (see Untamed for a fun example of her work!)  This is her first print-published book (by her own introduction) and she has progressed beyond this amateurish prose, growth that is noticeable from half-way through the novel.  There are some stirring moments in The Bride Wore Feathers and a very detailed sense of place throughout helping the reader to vividly imagine the Dakota frontier as it may have been in 1876.  Ms. Ihle has obviously done her historical research as well, depicting accurate details of the period, including Lakota traditions and ceremonies.As a fiction novelist,([...] I know it is hard to separate from the characters we have created and allow the editor in our mind reign to change the story but this is a case where further revisions could have made the first half of the novel better.",3

I don't like complaining about price. I feel authors have every right to earn a living, however this one was such a shock I couldn't just let it slide. The book ends 83% through, at 1390 locations. At $6.74, that's a very steep price. I would pay less for a paperback with around 350 pages. I regularly pay $2.99 for a book of this length. I find $6.74 to be an outrageous price for a novella I read in about 2 hours.That being said, this one was very good. I liked the characters, and felt the author did a very nice job with the PTSD element. In other stories I've read characters with PTSD will magically be cured by falling in love and sex. Which is a nice little fantasy, but so unrealistic that it always puts me off. Not so in this case. I find myself divided on recommendation.

I hadn&#8217;t encountered that genre before, or perhaps I never looked for one.  A romcom, or romantic comedy, in book form is an over the top, ridiculous view on romance and a means of poking fun (in my mind, making fun) of romances.  I love my romance, I love love and I most definitely love falling in love (over and over again in one book gives that book a 5 Hoots!).  I will not read another romcom, so to be clear, I read this at face value and was disappointed.  Only after talking with some goodreads friends did I see the merit of this book as a romcom genre type book.Beatriz (her name drove me nuts too&#8230;who can moan Beatrizzzz during sex???) was a take no prisoners, ballsy, hard-core gal.  She worked on the side as a sex blogger and found many men couldn&#8217;t handle the pressure.  The talking is what would drive me mad&#8230;who wants that much &#8220;thinking talking&#8221; during their smexy times???  Not me.  Maybe that was the romcom part.  Ben, on the other hand, was smart, funny, driven and romantic.  Ben has been in love with Beatriz since he met her, but with his future and his best friend&#8217;s future at stake, he resisted her and moved on with his life.

B004LRP14S,A15AMUTKT7GZ6,"12 5, 2011",Kris James,"Good, but unsatisfying","--from Red Adept Reviews--I received The Device, by Patrick Skelton, as a review copy submitted to ""Red Adept Reviews"" by the author.Description from author's website:Overall: 3 1/4 StarsPlot/Storyline: 3 StarsI love the beginning of this novel. It folds you into the action and explains everything you need to know without distracting from events. But I found myself waiting...and waiting...for the science fiction to kick in. The author does a (too) thorough job of shrouding potential sci fi events in mystery and apathy. The greater portion of the novel's events are left to deal with John's interpersonal relations, memories and medical conditions.When all begins to be revealed, it's both sudden and overdue.The main portion of the novel contains a steady, easy-to-maintain pace. I didn't sense much uptick as the conclusion neared, possibly as a consequence of such a thoroughly self-absorbed first person POV. The last three chapters felt jumbled, a collection of several disparate story elements swept together at the end instead of placed neatly like the rest of the novel's events. It didn't deliver a satisfying end, and I never found the ""frightening climax"" the blurb promised.Character Development: 4 StarsThis novel was written from a first person POV, so it makes sense that John's character is the most developed. Everything from his obsession with past events to his inability to carry through with large changes to his life helps reinforce his troubled existence.Other characters have much smaller roles, but all are well-crafted, and most remain consistent and true to character. Sam's good-old-boy bossiness is a joy to read. Dr. Elberton's superior attitude makes him seem larger-than-life, despite his brief appearance. Linford Daniels' political statements on global warming are hilariously infuriating, inviting many a facepalm.The story wouldn't have happened if John hadn't picked up the Device, but I found his persistence in trying to retrieve it from its difficult-to-reach location to be unbelievable and out of character. It went against all the other times he failed to follow through when given a new direction to pursue.Writing Style: 3 1/2 StarsI love Mr. Skelton's writing style. It is immersive without becoming boggy. Dialogue is emotive and character-specific: Jacob's speech patterns told me he was a well-educated man before events confirmed it. Sentences are crisp, with a clean feel of moving forward. The world of the protagonist, shown through first person, was my world. The tone of the character's outlook on life is consistent and thoroughly colors the novel's events.On the opposite side of that coin is the odd feeling that important things are passing me by, and John just doesn't care. Lisa, the love interest, didn't quite feel like she got a fair shake. Some critical features of her relationship with John are mentioned only in passing or in retrospect. Other items in the novel seem to waft past in the background. Two special gifts given to the protagonist are ignored nearly the full length of the plot.The Device itself is hardly in this book at all; the main character lets another party have it for ten years. During the denouement, John falls back on his inertia, and the end of the book seems to happen without him, which did not seem to be the intent of the story.It's unclear what the novel's perspective on global warming is. Strong opinions are voiced, but between plot developments and character associations, the issue is muddied.Editing: 3 1/2 starsMr. Skelton's writing style is very polished and easy to read...except for its bumper crop of spelling, punctuation and grammar (SPaG) errors. The first fourth of the novel has been scrubbed of typos, as if putting its best foot forward for the online sample, but after that the errors show up regularly. A thorough editing read-through could improve the reading experience greatly.Personal Enjoyment: 2 1/2 starsReading this book felt like watching a movie whose trailer touted it as the next Matrix, and finding it instead to be a deeply emotional Hallmark film narrated by Jeff Bridges. It wasn't a bad story, necessarily--it was just focused on entirely different issues than the blurb led me to believe. Readers take their cue from book blurbs to determine whether they'll be interested in the themes within. This blurb was highly misleading for me, and as a result, I spent too much time wondering when the ""real"" story would start and not enough enjoying the story that was presented.",3
B00FKOA0HY,AULBDDHV0LFR5,"12 23, 2013",Future Boy,Good character study,"This novella is an excellent character study.  The characters, a couple about to be married, are lovingly drawn.  We have a certain sense of who Justine and Daniel are, although I would have liked to learn more about Daniel.  Aside from wanting to work as a professor, and loving Justine and wanting a happy home with children, what drives him?Several authors have described successful fiction as the telling of essentially a conflict that requires action to resolve, which draws out character, and some sort of resolution.  Due to the short story structure, the only conflict that seems to stand out is when Daniel must decide between his love for Justine and the undesired prospect of working in a stifling, although highly paid, career for Justine's father.  This conflict is resolved so quickly that the reader is left looking for more.I do acknowledge the excellent writing and smooth, flowing style.  It's just that I was left wanting more.  I know the axiom is to have the reader wanting more at the end of the book, but in this case I felt so unknowing of the most potent story possible that I felt I'd just barely started.",3

There was no real sense that she really wanted to see the world it came across more as another obligation to fulfill, just the fact that she had no passport as opposed to her having to defer her dream to escape due to family illnesses.  As soon as the diaries were introduced I found myself thinking are they both daft, of course the answer would be in them!  Don't even get me started on the panty thing; Nick misconstruing the situation with the builder would have been more believable.

The synopsis has inspired me to immerse myself in the adventures of the trio but I was disappointed with the plot while turning pages.The seduction scene in the bar made me curious but the intimate diary miraculously discovered made me cringe. The author begins a fairly intense scene to leave the reader with an heroine who fled to get off with her sex toys... Two hot guys and you run after a dildo? No freaking way!So, I get annoyed by the opening and by Cyn's childish behaviour.The alternating hot and cold made &#8203;&#8203;me sigh. I had trouble getting into my reading and I've begun to tell me that I was wasting my time... When Jennifer Kacey managed to pique my curiosity. It all started with the club membership card and the circonstancies this card was given of course! To be honest, it was time to enter into the heart of the matter: the fantasies of Cyn.The arrival of new secondary characters has also spiced up the story and made it most compelling. The author has managed to combine the sensuality, suspense and some emotions in between the sex scenes. The scene in the library is a sensual feast and the one with the whip gave me the chills!The two brothers are hot as hell and I liked their different personality. They also distinguish themself from each others in their sexual preferences. Chris's tortuous past adds some chills to the story.If the story seemed disjointed, the author caught me by the hair to stay interested in her story by writing some intense sex scenes and engaging characters.

B00H9JHWJM,A1X0EDL50WFWQ9,"04 1, 2014",Penny Black,Too many loose ends,"It's been said that devil is in the details, but the problem I have with the latest installment of the Haberdashers series is there aren't many. Reading this book felt as if I've gotten an outline of the plot rather than the fully-fleshed out story. Very few events unfolded real time, having been replaced with firsthand accounts from the participants, and as a result, many opportunities for character development were lost in the process.That disappointed me because I would have liked to get to know Georgiana - she had a lot of potential as a heroine - but the secrets she kept from her friends were revealed late in the book and without adequate buildup. The hero didn't fare much better - his story was uncorroborated by any other characters - he was almost as much of an unknown at the end of the novel as he was when the heroine first met him in Vienna.It is possible, the timeline got in the way of the story: the first half of the novel happens before the first two books and the second half, when main characters from the previous books join the action, after. But if you didn't readAthena's Ordeal (The Haberdashers Book Two), chances are, you'll miss the gist of the conflict and the connection between the villains.I can't help but wonder if the plot took a back seat to the relationships among the Haberdashers, which, in all fairness, were done very well, in fact, much better than the heroine's family dynamics, the hero's history, or the conspiracy. But, even though I'm not thrilled with this latest installment, I'm cautiously optimistic about the next one. I'd like to see if the loose ends left dangling at the end of this book would get tied-up then. If not, there's always Charlie's story, which is, according to Ms. London, thematically similar toTrials of Artemis (The Haberdashers Book One), my favorite in the series so far.",3

How many husbands can she have and still have them all completely infatuated?  The pace and charecter development is similar to the rest of the series.I love the fact that the author has not sold out and raised her prices and her prolific writing speed is truly impressive as she spits out more novels.  But she needs to slow down just a tad and allow some more editing.  No major flaws but I did find a few paragraphs where a new character seemed to make a guest appearance then disappear.  The author is trying desperately to save the series by adding some weaknesses to Lissa's god powers.  Her efforts might be better spent building new characters or worlds.  She needs a strong editor to rain her back.  But the series continues to be fun to read, albeit getting a little formulaic.Overall I thought it was OK but the series could benefit from a rest, while author focuses on other endeavors.

Given the description of the story and the short length, I couldn't help but wonder if the author would be able to successfully tell the story [within 47 pages] without rushing it too much. I was happy to see that the story flowed quite smoothly, even at the fast pace in which the events take place.The story begins with Brooke - well, Abby as Brooke - escaping from a van. She isn't sure what happened or where she is. She can't remember where she lives, or who she is. All she remembers is waking up in the back of a van.When she finds herself at Brooke's house, she meets Will, who explains that she's a Shadow - someone who borrows other people's bodies to complete a task. Her real name is Abby Grace. Her reflection is hers, but her outer appearance is Brooke's. She was sent to fix something in Brooke's life, which she assumes is locating her brother, Paul. She has less than two days to fix things for Brooke, or else she'll be stuck in her body.There were moments where I did wish certain scenes were more fleshed out, especially the ending with Paul, but overall I did enjoy the story. I think the idea, Abby borrowing Brooke's body to help her fix something in her life, is interesting. It's something I haven't really read before.If I had to sum up ""Borrowing Abby Grace"", I'd say that it is a short and exciting story that leaves you wondering what comes next (enter: ""Girl Steals Guy"").",3

When Shawn takes a bullet protecting his brother, Jamal, he realizes that life has to change before it is too late.Deisha is dating Maurice both dealing with dysfunction in their families. Deisha is staying with her aunt and trying to have a normal life. She is also dealing with the fact that Maurice's mother does not care for her or their relationship. Maurice is focusing on his relationship with Deisha and blocking out his mother's concerns. Both decide pursuing college is their ticket of out their situation.A Thug's Redemption is a typical street lit book with drama and murder. The author does a wonderful job expressing the bond between the friends. On the other hand, this book had a lot of ancillary characters that did nothing for the storyline for me. Readers will be able to relate to the issues these six friends experience. This book had a slow start but picked up keeping my interest. It had an unsuspected ending that seemed to leave readers hanging, which leads me to believe there is more to these characters lives. This book had some grammatical errors but I was able to keep up with the storyline.

B002YK44YW,A37DQ0R2I2EC9V,"11 11, 2010",Joel Griffith,Could have been - but failed to be  - excellent.,"If you like the early Anita Blake books, you might enjoy this short novel.  It stars a kick-ass protagonist dealing with the good and the bad of various paranormal players, and taking the lead in trying to stop a super-powerful evil adversary who threatens both the paranormal and mundane worlds.  Unfortunately, the editing was horrid.  The story abounds with misspelled words, missing words, duplicated words, missing or incorrect punctuation, gramatical errors, and so on, to the point that the story was often difficult to follow.  Consequently, neither did the plot move forward as smoothly, nor were the characters developed as fully, as the author no doubt intended.  The book ends with umresolved issues which will presumably be addressed in other volumes, and I will probably read them at some point, but it's a shame, because I suspect that if the editing had been better, this author might have been on my must read list.",3

B002U0KVQQ,A3EQRFI17IJZ8V,"10 7, 2013","Cate Agosta ""Book Nut Hut Owner""",Interesting little novella,"This is an interesting little novella at just over 200 pages, and is definitely something one would want to pick up if they are looking for something new to read.The storyline revolves around four characters and a cross-country road-trip which, in itself makes for an interesting read. Although the book is well written and intriguing, the length of the novella is not enough to give any in-depth and engrossing back story to the characters, and it is told through the words of the main protagonist. However, along the way, the Author manages to bring into the journey, so very interesting and very flawed sub-characters, which add to the tale very nicely. One thing the Author does achieve very well with the writing of his characters, is the feeling of their growth as the journey continues and they begin to learn things about themselves, and others, that they previously were unaware of; this gives a sense of reality to the characters, and also makes the reader wonder, how much do they actually know about the people they associate with, and is their view on the world they live in skewed by preconceptions.The journey they take is written in compelling and curious ways that makes you keep reading on to an almost realistic ending that keeps the feelings of practicality and realism that are written in to the novella throughout. The only issue I had with the Kindle version of this read were the typos that could have been picked up by a good proof-reader and/or editor, and this did detract from my enjoyment of this book.I would recommend this book to readers of Murakami Haruki, and other Japanese contemporary Authors.Originally reviewed on: [...]",3

Wheaton ""T.W.""",Geek-tastic heroine & sexy hero are stand outs in a story that just misses the mark,"There is a lot to like in this book, but ultimately it doesn't quite soar.First the good:I LOVE geek-tastic heroines.  Love them.  Kansas is a great addition to the geek girl romance heroine family.  She has a Tardis on her shower curtain and sci-fi references sprinkle her dialogue throughout the book.Jett was also a great hero.  Not too alpha-hole, but nicely authoritative.The conflict was internal and believable.  Kansas' hang-ups could have easily become frustrating, but the author didn't let them.  She knew when to dial back.  Having just read another book where the heroine's hang ups totally stymied the relationship and made me frustrated beyond belief, this was refreshing.There were a couple of times when it seemed like Jett and Kansas were on the cusp of going into a Grand Misunderstanding.  But, again, the author knew when to dial back and allowed them to communicate instead.Really liked how the author explored Jett's involvement in his fiancee's illness -- how he approached it, what he felt about it, how he helped her deal with it -- the whole thing.For the most part the writing was great.  There were absolute flashes of brilliance in the dialogue.  I loved ""listening"" to the characters speak to each other.And yet....The not-so-goodAlthough I loved Kansas and Jett as individuals, I did not feel the connection or chemistry between them.  Honestly there was a bit of insta-love there that did not 100% convince me.I think the issue here has to do with length.  According to All Romance Ebooks, this book clocks in at 32,710 words.  In it, there is a prologue, family issues on Kansas' side, ex-fiancee issues on Jett's side plus the two of them meet, have their own romantic conflicts, fall in love,and have an HEA.  That is a lot to work with in under 200 pages.There are some intriguing aspects of the families we only get glimpses of.  His job as a Hollywood  actor seemed to be a huge trigger for his ex-fiancee's illness, I would have enjoyed discovering if what effect getting involved with a hollywood star it might have on Kansas too.  I think Jett and Kansas' actual ""falling in love"" gets short-changed.  It feels like a chapter later and BooM! they are in love.  There were a lot of interesting ideas that we only get the surface scratched.Also, as I mentioned above while the writing was overall very good but there were places here and there where the exposition felt clunky and awkward. Character physical descriptions often felt like police blotter descriptions, complete with height, weight and detailed skin colors.  And the love scenes read as very porny, not just erotic.I really liked the characters and the dialogue, but feel that so much potential story gets missed and not explored that in the end the book doesn't 100% work for me.",3

B004XDYXN0,A1FEBL7652SEPS,"06 4, 2011","Jennifer Scarpa ""Jenn of Frequent Reader, Inf...",A Story Not To Be Missed by Fans of the Iron Fey,"***NOTE MY REVIEWS OFTEN CONTAIN SPOILERS***A First Person Narrative, told from Robin Goodfellow's point of view, Summer's Crossing is a delightful adventure into the Summer Fey Kingdom. This short story picks up right where Iron Queen left off.  I'm not sure if it's necessary to understanding the print books of the series, however Kagawa offers a free copy on her facebook page so it doesn't make sense to miss this story.  When Ash and Puck begin their journey to find Grimalkin and hopefully discover a way for Ash and Meghan to be together, they are stopped by Leansidhe who calls in the favor Ash promised her in the Iron Queen.  She asks Ash to journey into the Summer Kingdon and retrieve a violin that Titania has stolen from her.  Without Puck's help Ash won't be able to finish his quest alive, but if Puck helps him he's not only betraying his kingdom, but helping his rival get one step closer to getting the woman that they both love.The story is a page turner from beginning to end and a delightful read in Puck light and easy going voice.  It allows you a look into this character that the other stories told from Meghan's point of view don't offer.  You really feel the emotional battle within Puck and it leaves you guessing until the very end just what decision he will make.  You couldn't completely blame him if he sold Ash out because it would eliminate his competition for Meghan's love, but at the same time he had years to proclaim his love and shouldn't have waited until Ash showed up to do so.  Also if he really loves Meghan he should want her to be happy even if the person that makes her happy isn't him.  Puck battles with the decision of what to do throughout the entire story and you can't help but feel for him.  I really can't think of much negative to say about this story except that there just isn't enough of it.  Being a novel reader, short stories just don't have the meat that I look for in a story.  However if you love the Iron Fey series this isn't a title to be missed.",4

B008VSW614,A1Q434SYE6K31Q,"11 21, 2012",Charlene,"Inspiring, realistic contemporary drama","I feel there are two strong emotional arcs in this story that make up the heart of the narrative. The first is the loss of Lucy's sister in a car accident and the devastating effects on her family. The emotional realism of Lucy's deteriorating family is vivid and well-realized, and made me choke up multiple times. I felt like the author brilliantly captured the emotion of this family trauma and Lucy's efforts to cope drove the first part of the story.In comparison, the second emotional arc - the romantic attachment between Lucy and Chris, the secret musician felt less well-built. It's insta-love on a certain level, although Lucy and Chris's emotional damage does explain their strong connection. I did feel that this part of the story could have been more effective dramatically if more time was spent on Lucy and Chris getting to know each other. And with Chris I would have liked to know more about his character - his history and what drives his behavior.  The tension over Chris's volatile personality was perfectly pitched however, as I was very intrigued by his character.This book was a quick read for me, because the author did a great job building the characters of Lucy and her family and I wanted to know more about how her relationship with Chris and her friends would help heal her.

Makes one think how our actions ultimately affect other people.Maxwell Sheppard can be loosely identified as a modern-day Robin Hood, except he kept all the loot to himself. He ends up in prison and shortly after, the consequences of his decisions comes back to him and causes him to seek atonement.Even at the start, Max didn't really look much of  bad guy so it was easy to empathize with him (especially because we first see him already in jail and we didn't get to see him in the midst of his criminal days).

Winter's Wrath: Sacrifice did not disappoint! Dr. Williams reaches all new levels of evil, Meg's evolving powers have made her an emotional powder keg, and Cole's injecting himself with the Infinity serum has unexpected results. Romances bloom everywhere, and the love triangle between Meg, Cole, and Creed becomes even more complicated.First I'll explain why this review is 4.5 stars. For me, I missed a lot of the action that was present in the first three books. Most of it happened toward the end, and we spent a lot of time dealing with Meg's emotional stuff. I get that emotion is part of her ability. But after a while I wanted my girl to stop passing out and get up and kick some butt like she did in the other books! However, she seems to find her own in the end, which I loved and it made me excited for book 4. I also would have liked to see more going on with Alik as I can sense him growing as a meta and a person. I hope there's more of him in book 4.Cole began to come across as a bit selfish, but hey, he's a teenager. What teenager isn't selfish, especially when it comes to love. I'll be interested to see how things evolve, although at this point, I am squarely in Creed's corner. For me, he is the shining star of this book. Ever since I was introduced to him in book 2, I've been in love with him. My love lives on! Team Creed!Overall, this book is solid and entertaining, a fun read for young adults and grownups alike.

B00IT03ZNM,A27WUZJUM2DHXN,"03 17, 2014","Anne ""Anne""","Nice collection, great intro to new to the reader authors at .99","While I had heard about many of the authors included, I hadn't read any of their work (despite having Delicate Freakin Flower for a couple of years).  I was given an ecopy by one of the authors in exchange for my honest review.While the stories have the basic werewolf/shifter set up, hot, protective alpha males and similar world building, the variety of stories kept me interested.  2 out of the 12 were DNFs primarily due to slow story development in both and one having a just graduated teen as the heroine.  Not from an ""ick"" young heroine point because her guy was also a just graduated teen, but she was totally uninteresting.  There were some typos, punctuation errors, wrong/missing words in a few books, none so bad I couldn't enjoy the read.  Delicate Freakin Flower was one of the worst.  As I mentioned, it's been out for a while, it could (should) have been revised.  There is sex in every story at a moderate level I felt for shifter books in 2014.Romancing the Wolf-  The story of two sisters finding out about wolf shifters.  Primarily focuses on Bree and is a fairly typical PNR.  Delia's story, the younger sister, is kind of thrown in.  It was a bit too much for an intro to a character a possible next book might be focused on, yet not enough for this to really be her book.  I liked Bree's portion better because Delia was a sadist domme and we learn more than once that she loves having sex with shifters because there's no need for safe words and she can do WHATEVER she wants as long as there's no silver because they'll heal.  Sorry, no, that doesn't work for me.  Especially because, in an interesting twist, these weres (BTW most are gay, if not, bi) get hopped up on Ecstasy on full moon nights so they have no will and really can't say no.  Granted, they do seem to be enthusiastic and willingly come to her, but there is an ""ick"" factor here for me.Curves for the Lone Alpha-  James is forced to work as a enforcer for the FBI and meets his mate.  I liked that James didn't moan and groan having to work for the FBI.  He was doing it to find out more about why his pack was killed and he did the job without being angsty.The Alpha Claims a Mate-  My favorite of the bunch.  I liked all the characters and there was a nice bunch of interesting secondary characters and a mystery to boot.  Some reviews about this book as a single mention the BDSM scene was being out of place and excessive.  I didn't feel that way because BDSM is fairly common in shifter books because the alphas tend to be so dominant.  Ginger, the heroine, TELLS Loch that he can punish her any way he wants and he even asks her again if she's sure.  When they get to the club, he makes sure she wants to come in (she's even eager) and he gives her a safeword.  While there, the author doesn't put in much detail about what's happening to others and Ginger is fully clothed from the waist up and is wearing full cut hipsters.  She gets 10 whacks, a little care and off they go.  That's it, BDSM ultralight.All American Wolf - I felt this one had the most developed story about a female detective who meets two men while investigating some unusual murders.Charming the Alpha - Hannah, a witch fes strangely attracted to the wolf alpha.  Wolves are getting abducted and Hannah helps save the day and finds out something new about herself.Change for Me - This is the story about the teen I found uninteresting and the story slow to develop.  DNF.Bear King's Curves - Yay! some werebears .  Interesting story about bear antiquities getting stolen by a sexy thief who is thwarted by a bear enforcer who finds out the clan has some secrets.Witchy Wolf - Chloe wakes up in the hospital after a werewolf attacks her.  She doesn't realize that she's ""special"" and when she turns for the first time there are some surprises.  She's also torn between the PI and cop she meets.  The story has a mystery around Chloe's dad and ends abruptly.A Change to Bear -  Terry has a terrible job and a not so great family and just takes off for Asia and basically foists herself on Liam, a fellow traveler,  Liam has some secrets, but the story moves so slowly and is more of a travelogue than a PNR that I gave up.  DNFDelicate Freakin Flower - Wolf, bear and jaguar triad.  Very reminiscent of Shelley Laurenston.  Had one good lout loud laugh at the beginning.Protecting the Pack - Another fated triad story with a little m/m action.  Outsiders try to infiltrate two established packs and take them over.The Alpha's Mate - A shifter unable to change into her wolf gets help from the alpha to be.  As she's getting adjusted, a rival for her mate' affection causes trouble and there are female shifters disappearing.  Chloe's a bit of a doormat at the beginning but comes into her own.",4

She and her brother, Thomas, both came down with a terrible fever, but only Ambrosia survived. She has 3 younger sisters and wants to be a perfect example for them. Ambrosia only has 3 things in her live that she can have complete CONTROL of, order, routine and schedules. Control is her greatest ally , but also her greatest enemy.Duncan Maddox, Earl of Bristol, is a rake, gambler, lover of loose women and drinks like a fish. His parents couldn't be in the same room together without words, vases and scandals flying. His older brother, Jason, was the perfect heir apparent and when Duncan became like his father, a rake, gambler, lover of loose women and drunkard, he was banished to their country estate, so not to influence Jason. Now his father and Jason are dead and he must pick up the Maddox name, brush it off, polish the family reputation, marry a respectable woman with money and do all this before is only remaining relative, Uncle Richard, dies.That the beginning of Ambrosia 4th (shocking, I know) Season, she dodges her mother and another suitor and winds up in the library with a half naked, wet, yummy, Adonis looking and, did I mention yummy, sculptured man. Duncan was caught in a rain storm and drying by the library fire, when this heavenly vision walks in and he is captivated. Ambrosia knows she will be compromised if found alone with this male. Duncan tries to introduce himself, but she doesn't want to know. The next thing she knows, she is pulled into his arms and he precedes to kiss her until her toes curl. Duncan can't believe this lovely woman doesn't know to kiss and begins to teach her how. Ambrosia freaks out and flees the library.Duncan reconnect with his only friend James, the Duke of Kenning, and it's decided between them that he must use his famous Maddox charm, court her and if he must, COMPROMISE Miss Ambrosia Tisdale and all his problems will be solved. Thus begins a dance between this two black and white individuals. Ambrosia is rude, evasive, not going out and hiding if she has to. She must make Duncan back off because when she is around him, her mind doesn't function properly. Duncan sees this perfect and so proper woman, but underneath he knows she isn't so wounded up. Every time this two are near water, they are become full of dirt and water logged and then they lips lock, have wandering hands and almost get down and dirty. They have a scheming sister, lots of water, a debauched Duke, toe curling kisses, more water, harsh and hurtful words, a meddling uncle and a traditional family house party to shake up and maybe bring together these two crazy kids together! Can Ambrosia learn that being perfect is not a life? How much can Duncan screw up her schedules, orderly life and routines? Will the Duke help or hurt them both? How long will it take Duncan to believe in love? Will Ambrosia let all the weight off her shoulders and let Duncan carry her burdens? When will Duncan realizes that he DESERVES LOVE?This is my first Ms. Jefferson's book and I must said,(insert pompoms here)&#34;YEAH!&#34; She has a great cast of crazy, hilarious and original characters. I love the kooky and slightly disturbed Tisdale family. The names are even unique, Ambrosia, Flora and Tamsin. Ambrosia was a great wounded and scarred on the inside heroine and I could feel her pain and misery about the loss of her brother and I had a good (but ugly) cry. Duncan was a lone wolf and he was in so much pain and his saving grace and torment was his Uncle Richard. Duncan wanted so right so many wrong, but he lack motivation. Ms. Jefferson made her hero and heroine look their fear in the eyes, confront, understand and then begin a journey of healing. She created an amazing, hilarious and kooky Tisdale world and I can't wait to wiggle, crawl and infiltrate this Tisdale universe again to enjoy Tamsin story.

B006ECFWBA,A3MT311233OHMQ,"01 12, 2013","Sophia Rose ""Guest Reviewer for Delighted Rea...",Splendid Sci-Fi Romance,"This was a nice blend of the Sci-Fi with the paranormal along with the romance. The blurb is what originally drew me to the book and I was not disappointed.The story opens with the High Queen of Ontariese making a personal sacrifice to do what she must for the Kingdom which is on the brink of civil war. The Queen uses her mage power to send her twin daughters through a portal hiding them in two separate places to be retrieved when they are needed. Many years later, the war continues with no chance of relief and an evil mage plots the downfall of all for his own greed for power. Tal, a mage, Trey, his brother, and Vee, Tal's mentor set out to find him and also foil the evil mage's plot that takes him to earth.Then the scene changes to present day earth where Charlotte sits in her mountain cabin contemplating her future of moving to Seattle, completing the Bar exam, and getting a job with a nice law firm. That same night, an odd lightning storm changes her fate when it brings Tal dar Aune, an Ontarian, into her life.Tal is mystified as to why this earth woman, Charlotte is of interest to his enemy, but he vows to keep her safe and with him until the answers can be found. Tal and Charlotte race for their lives even as Charlotte fights to break away from him at first, but then the clues start building up and all lead to one thing- Charlotte is much more than she seems and may be the answer for all of Ontariese.The plot kept moving at a good pace even as the author deftly fit in the explanation to the Ontariese world. I love Sci-fi for its creative world-building and this story offered the interesting concept of magically gifted people and a matriarchal-style society. It was exciting during the cat and mouse chases to keep Charlotte out of danger and the slow build up of her relationship that went beyond attraction with Tal. I loved the little twists that occurred a few times to keep things from getting blase'. Tal and Charlotte were stumped a few different times when they tried to be together.But I think my favorite part of the book was Charlotte herself. At first, she seemed to be a human woman who has known heartbreak and is lonely, but her exposure to Tal and the other Ontariese along with their trouble shows she is no marshmallow. She doesn't allow them to bully her, but at the same time she's not prone to act stupidly or get whiny when her whole world changes on her. She is saddened by her losses and fearful of change, but she goes with it and that's my kind of gal. I like that she doesn't play around with Tal. She might disagree with him- actually she does disagree with him and frequently- but this doesn't make her sulk or have to much pride to meet him half-way or wish to mend things. Yes, she had gifts, but it was fun the way her human law degree was what served her almost as well.Tal is a strong male who because of his talent as a mage has a lot to learn still. He is strong on his traditions and has to be shown that it is the principles underlying the traditions that are the more important. He has had a lot of loss and sorrow in his life and he wants Charlotte, but he must learn the value of compromise and the learn that others without his talents have value before he can achieve what he most desires.So all in all, it was a fab sci-fi PNR romance and I look forward to the rest of the series. I hope to get Trey's story and more of the other characters too.",4

Bentley is beginning to realize his feelings for Ceci are more than just casual and begins to question her motives and place in his life. With each question that he asks, Ceci is building a larger web of lies and is slowly blurring the lines of her own mission. The chemistry between Ceci and Bentley is off the charts in Volume two and the story itself begins to narrow in. There is a shocking reveal at the end.

B00GIOQ70Y,A3IT9Z7O9IK7BM,"11 14, 2013",Shirley Quinones,"Impressive, interesting and enjoyable","In the small town of San Aplastar there's a standing tradition, a coming-of age type of event if you will, that teens from 13-18 years of age are expected take a part in. The teens and most adults that have grown up in the little beach town are forever affected by this event. You see, at &#34;The Assignment&#34; a select teens are 'labeled' according to an specific trait. It ranges from &#34;The Queen Bee&#34; to the &#34;Heartthrob&#34; all the way through to &#34;The Outcast&#34;. The teen that has been assigned the particular trait has to act it out and must treat each assignee accordingly until the Friday before Labor Day.Chloe is not planning to participate this year, especially after what happened the year before. But due to actions beyond her control she is registered and assigned the title of &#34;The Crush&#34;. Having recently met Casper, a newcomer to the town, she just wants to enjoy her summer like a normal teenager. But that is not to be. What ensues is a series of events, confessions and betrayals that just may prove how dangerous &#34;The Assignment&#34; really is.The town name of San Aplastar fits perfectly for this story. Aplastar in Spanish means to smash, squash, or to crush. And that is exactly what &#34;The Assignment&#34; leads to. It crushes any chance for the teens of the town to lead a normal life, for they'll be judge according to their assigned trait.C.M. Stunich is a new-to-me author and she impressed me with this story. It was original, full of angst and unexpected twists and turns. She managed to bring to the page all the teen angst expected when cliques are formed and secrets fester while still keeping it real, different and entertaining. I enjoyed the anticipation of of finding out which character was getting which trait and how they acted it out. It was surreal and over-the-top but, oh so enjoyable.Although there were a lot of characters and at times it was overwhelming to keep up with them, I enjoyed what they each brought to the story. Casper was sweet, caring and protective. As a newcomer, he couldn't understand why this event took place or why any one would willingly participate. His experience was harrowing even if he didn't participate in it. His sister, a lovely girl with a strong character and an even stronger heart, was the one who suffered the most, but her attitude was refreshing and I could completely understand why she decided to participate.Chloe was also a great character to get to know. Smart, honest to a fault and determined to get to the bottom of what was happening, she kept the story afloat when at times I thought it was bound to go under. I liked that she stood for what she believed in and that she wasn't easily swayed. Her developing romance with Casper was sweet and I was happy to see her making the right decisions when it came to him.I can't say anymore without giving too much away, but I will say that Crushing Summer was not like anything I had read before. This was a wonderful story complete with a great concept and a complex cast of characters. So if you're in the mood for an angsty young adult read with an interesting mystery and a little bit of romance this is the story for you.",4

B009QY4EAS,A37APF2XOO3B5Z,"11 14, 2012",M. Wanchoo,Interesting prequel,"From Man To Man is the debut short story by D.E.M. Emrys, a prequel to his heroic fantasy book It Began With Ashes book one of The Wroge Elements saga. I've been fascinated by the veracity and ingenuity of Emry's book reviews that I've read (so far) as he was able to channel the essence of the book skillfully into his reviews, making them a thorough pleasure to read. Also he's a self-professed fan of David Gemmell and his debut book might be inspired by this legendary writer, which also amps up my anticipation for this title.From Man To Man focuses on Draven Reinhardt, an older ex-warrior who hasn't lost any of his deadly martial skills, however has lost the reasons to continue as a warrior. He lives in a small village called Hidann wherein he strives to tread the path of an honest person working small but menial jobs. However destiny and his attitude mark him out to be otherwise. Soon after his most recent job loss, he gets an offer to use his skills albeit in a role as a guard, however things are never as crystal clear as they seem. Draven needs to find out whether he can continue to be the person he is attempting to be and also figure out where his future lies ultimately.The author writes with a fairly sharp prose style, he sets up the story and introduces Draven and his miserable situation. This short story gives a stark look into what happens to the life of an ex-soldier and this perhaps is a dicey move as with the length of the story, it leaves the readers wanting to know more but not getting their due. The pace of the story is something that helps, as the story never loses steam and once the situation is set up, the reader is drawn into Draven's world and thoughts. The reader will then have to follow through to the end of the tale wanting to see how it ends and what does Draven accomplish.In my estimation this is a good short story with some deficiencies in regards to the story setup. Also the end action sequence & climax perhaps raises more questions than the answers it provides. It does however leave the reader with a strong desire to know more about the world and about Draven, who as an axe man, has big boots to fill. From Man To Man does serve its intended purpose to intrigue readers, present the main character and showcase the author's skills. In the end I can vouch that it's a good short story, which ends a bit sooner than expected. There's also an excerpt of the upcoming book It Began With Ashes that helps in knowing more about the story to come. Give it a shot; I know I will, as I'll be waiting to see where D.E.M. Emrys takes the story next.",4
B00B8X1N22,A1MRANXX3DTI8W,"04 6, 2013","VampBard ""~*VampBard*~""","Best of series, thus far!","Caressed by a Crimson Moon brings the reader a fabulous continuation of the Rulers of Darkness series.  Ms. Greene brings her characters to life, and allows the reader access to the inner thoughts in a way that respects both the reader and characters.  Hadrian, the hero, is DEFINITELY on the list of favorite heroes for 2013!I think one of my favorite aspects of Caressed by a Crimson Moon is the utter self-loathing both Eva and Hadrian have for themselves.  I mean, -zero- self-esteem for these two!  The transformation of each character, while incomplete by the end of the title, was a fabulous glimpse at mending a wounded psyhe.  I think that I enjoyed watching the inner turmoil of each character change and morph as much as I enjoyed the interaction between the characters.  HEAT INDEX:  4.5 out of 5.  However, this is because anticipation and the 'pre-game show' is extremely erotic.One of the things that I felt was interesting about Caressed by a Crimson Moon was the sparse cast of characters.  Seriously.  We had Falcon, Hadrian's friend and second-in-command.  There was a chef and a butler.  We caught glimpses of Dorian and Dmitri, as well as their mates, as well as Sonya, and the Shaw Healer-in-Training.  Not a lot of characters.  There was no movement for the other characters, except at the end - Sonya and Falcon - I'm guessing they'll be the axis for the next title.  And... I. Can't. WAIT!!!  I adore Falcon almost as much as I do Hadrian.  Fans of Nalini Singh's Psy/Changeling series, Gena Showalter's Lords of the Underworld, and J.R. Ward's BDB are in for a treat - this Rulers of Darkness title seems to blend them together in a manner that is simply delicious!Eva is a truly interesting character.  Raised to believe that she was half jaguar shifter and half human, Eva has always felt like an outcast to her jaguar clan.  When her mom died, Eva was immersed in the world of her father, and their pack didn't have any use for remaining current & relevent in technology.  She was also treated as though she were an abomination, and says so in Caressed by a Crimson Moon.  She endured nine years of abuse-by-neglect, at the hands of her father.  On the other side, Eva called herself a half-breed, and dismissed her thoughts as unimportant.  She felt she wasn't deserving of happiness because she had been made to believe so for many years.  This was totally evident in the way she thought of herself, and the way she didn't believe that there was any way that Hadrian would want her.  I found it interesting, after a major event for her character, that she still didn't believe that Hadrian felt anything for her.  I must admit, there were several times I wanted to tell her, ""Suck it up, Buttercup.  The self-pity thing isn't working for you.""  Fortunately, it seems as though she hopped off the Pity Train by the end of the title, when Hadrian needed her support.  Yay, you!Hadrian.  Rawr!  He's awake and ready to lead his clan through rebuilding and keep the peace.  Since he was in self-imposed exile for 350-ish years, Hadrian is a bit behind the times when it comes to technology and social trends and norms.  However, he's ready to kick-ass and take names later, if that is what needs to happen!  When I found out **why** Hadrian is so morose, my heart broke for him.  Feeling responsible for someone's death is never easy.  Much more difficult when that someone is your TWIN BROTHER!  I'm glad I felt like that was resolved by the time we reached the end of the story.  I don't think I could have handled the continuation of that storyline.  What I'm not entirely cool with is the demon which is Hadrian's vampire.  Previously, vamps were created by a bite.  Although, Hadrian is possessed by a demon, and it was implied that the demon caused the vampirism.  That part of the plot confused me a little, but it was easy to take the leap of faith and simply go with it.  **VampBard, shut up the constant analysis and enjoy the damn book!**  Long story short, the demon played nice, and Hadrian got his anger issues under control.  As matter of fact, his middle name should be CONTROL. The compassion I had for Hadrian throughout the title was immense.  I cried, people.  Giant, crocodile tears, when I found out why Hadrian hated himself so much.  Another round of tears when Hadrian 'said goodbye' to his brother.  Seriously.  I've warned you.  Have tissues at-the-ready.  Ultimately, this vamp who felt himself unworthy of love discovered that the true meaning of love is to accept someone as they are, and not expect change as a condition of a relationship.  This is one of the reasons I fell in total lurve with Hadrian.Caressed by a Crimson Moon is my favorite Rulers of Darkness title to-date.  The third book in the series has me chomping at the bit for the next installment.***I received a copy of this title for review purposes***",4

B00K0T2UBS,A1X2URS71RRMMF,"05 3, 2014","Jeannie Zelos ""jeanie zelos book reviews""",sexy and erotic romance,"Awakening, Sydney HolmesReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsI liked the description and quickly got into this book. Nora's a person it's easy to like, hard working, ambitious, has good friends, a responsible job and a boyfriend of three years. She's trying to spice up their sex life, and he thinks she's lost it, as far as he's concerned they're fine and she's some kind of sexual oddity to want more....Slowly the disenchantment grows - the plan was for her to take time out while he built his career, then she's start law school but as time has passed her plans seem to get dropped by him, and have become a kind of pipe dream. The vibrant, energetic Nora, the one who wanted so much from life, has been put on the back burner and from only seeing her once midweek, and at weekends, and being horrified when she suggested they move in together, he's now talking about marriage, kids and ignoring her want for a law career...Poor Nora, its not til things really go wrong that she can see what her friends have long noticed, her boyfriend isn't interested in her for herself, has no intention of helping her get to Law School, just sees her as an accompaniment to him, and for what she can do to support his career.Then she meets Ryan...he's incredible, but they get off to a bad start when he's being hot and cold, and she doesn't know what to make of him. Neither did I at times :-)  She and Darren have a row and he says it's over. So with a clear head she does what she wants, and starts dating Ryan. Wow - he is one hot, spicy man and all the adventurous ideas about sex she's had are game on for him. They have some really torrid, erotic experiences. Then as always doubts set in, Darren tries to get back with her, Ryan's ex girlfriend gives her some cagey, non specific warnings about what Ryan likes sexually,  and what was a beautiful and exciting relationship seems to be toppling..I loved this book, full of great characters and real situation - the wedding invite the ""wrong"" shade of red. Can just imagine that....Some people become obsessive about tiny, immaterial details for what they feel is an important event. Bridezilla and all that!! Ryan and Nora have an off the charts chemistry, and these scenes are written in a very sensual way, erotic and passionate without any of that squirky, stomach churning stuff that creeps into many books when writers add sex to a story. Here it's perfect, fits well and makes the book so much more than just a romance. My only criticism is that when things started to go wrong I felt the drama was lacking a bit - I felt for Nora, but didn't get moved to tears or anything close to it, and the ending - it was good but just felt very abrupt. I turned the page expecting more and...that was it. End of story. Its a complete ending, it's just that I thought there would be a bit more to it.Stars: Four, little more drama, stronger ending and this would have been a five.ARC supplied via NetgalleyEdit: I've since seen that there is a follow up book planned, so we'll see more of Ryan and Nora",4

Being a paranormal investigator and having an incredible best friend has helped her immensely.

Knowing what is a dream and what is reality becomes more and more difficult for her as time goes on. The man haunting her dreams even visits her while awake.

B005DUR1ZY,ARDEL78KSCDX8,"11 22, 2012",Laura Little Read Riding Hood,A good Vampire/Werewolf YA story,"Having received this book to review for an upcoming book tour, I had no clue what to expect. I had never heard of Wheeler, so going in I had zero expectations. Which, I have to say, was refreshing for a change.And as it turns out, I really enjoyed her writing style, and felt for the characters. Though her story did follow your typical YA Vampire/Werewolf romance, except you don't really know who is what for a while which I found terribly intriguing. She also switched points of view occasionally, giving you many sides to what was going on, but never so much that you felt you knew what was going to happen.Some would probably argue here was ""insta-love"" between Lexie and Torin (side note: I love his name!) but I would disagree. Their instant attraction was explained, pretty thoroughly. and I thought it was very sweet.My one and only complaint, if you could call it one, was there seemed to be, at times, religious undertones. But it was used more in the ""genesis"" story of one of the supernatural creatures, so I suppose it isn't any different than using Greek gods or Irish Fae as the basis for the genesis.I will most definitely continue on with this series, and look forward to reading more from Wheeler.",4

B008PODBAO,A12NWV26GSNYZC,"11 9, 2012","Magritte ""Snowdancer""",A sweet story... but not the author's best,"Some month ago I discovered Cindy C. Bennett's bookHeart on a Chain and I simply loved it... One day I was into reading stories about the beauty and the beast and downloaded this one without even noticing who the author, when I noticed I started reading it and couldn't stop. Then I continued with the next one of her series, this one about the red riding hood.I have to admit I am a real girl loving fairy tales and I really like this author. Now, if you add two things you like together... it can only be good. This time however my opinion is not so enthusiastic.The series of short stories has been published in the following order, but doesn't have to be read in this order:Beautiful Beast (Enchanted Fairytales)Red and the Wolf (Enchanted Fairytales)Snow White (Enchanted Fairytales)Rapunzel UntangledRafe und Ruby have been best friends for many years, but 3 years ago he leaves after their first kiss and even stops writing her after some time. She feels rejected and abandoned, has the feeling her heart is broken, even Lowell's (Rafe's brother) flirting doesn't make her feel better. When Rafe comes back, decided to win her heart forever, but without given any explanation about his disappearance she runs from him afraid to get hurt. When a wolf starts to threaten their town and after the call of her grandmother things change and he forced her to protect her, but the danger is not always where one expects it.There is a definite fantasy part in this story. Like in a traditional fairy tale is takes place somewhere, sometime.... Like always I enjoyed the writing, it had rhythm, was simple and easy to follow not having a lot of characters but just enough.What disappointed me however this time is that I had the impression to have already read/ seen this story: in Twilight or The red riding hood. There was no real suspense or surprise for me and the characters didn't have as much depth as usually.Maybe it is because I expected too much, knowing what Mrs. Bennett is able of. It is however a fast and nice read, nothing too complicate, a cute and sweet story.Please feel free to comment.Enjoy the read MBTM",4

There are a lot of intense damsel in distress moments, lots of unexpected twists and turns in the plot, and lots of hot, steamy love scenes. Ironically, my one complaint is there were a few too many love scenes; sometimes less is more exciting, you can learn to get used to the making love scenes when there are too many of them. Some of the more negative reviews have complained that the book is unrealistic, like the amount of time that Dallas is absent from her job, but it's an erotic, romance novel so it shouldn't be completely realistic; it's supposed to be a fantasy!  Plus, it's well written with a hot alpha hero and a smart, spunky heroine, and great secondary characters (I could definitely see spin off books about Regg and Red; Brooklyn and Ronnie).

Most beings in the paranormal world had assumed her dead after all those years except for werewolf Jamie O'Connell. Knowing that werewolf blood had put Iona under and that only another Alpha weres blood could wake her, Jamie makes it his goal to save her from her prison and use Iona as tool for his own personal vendetta.Iona finally wakes up from her fifteen year ""sleep"" with a strange man looking over her. Confused and angry, Iona quickly escapes from her savior and tries to get back to the life she had once known. Losing fifteen years of her life, Iona sets out seek revenge on the werewolf who imprisoned her and those who aided him. On the hunt for blood to regain her strength, Iona learns that the only blood that appeals to her pallet is Jamie O'Connell's. Since Jamie's blood was what awakened her from her ""sleep"" she is now bounded to him. Infuriated with the fact that she's once again under another weres control, Iona sets her own plans for revenge against her first captor while using Jamie along the way.Sexual tension is bound to arise between Iona and Jamie while they use each other for their own personal vendettas and learn of the secrets from each other's past. I sympathized with Iona because she was robbed so of her time and life. Although she was known for being evil wicked and soulless in the past, Iona is simply a Vampire who's had to endure so much pain and deceit and had to do what she needed to survive. Jamie also shields his own dark past filled with rejection and loss. He might be a big, bad and scary wolf but deep down inside he's a good guy. Along the way they come to understand that their bond might not just be blood related but goes deeper than what each had expected.Although the books in the Bound series are short they move at a quick pace and is filled with sexy vampires and scorching hot werewolves. Eden's novellas contain the perfect amount of romance, sexual tension and action that comes with a full paranormal romance novel. If you're looking for a good and quick paranormal romance read, I suggest you pick up Eden's Bound series.",4

I have never been abused in any way, and I can't imagine what kinds of feelings are associated with it. The book was really good, but it is a bit graphic and it took an emotional toll on me to read it.I did like this one. Like I said the subject matter was difficult to read, but the story was really good. It did take me a while to read, as I had to put it down a couple of times and get my head away from it. But I always came back to it because it is such a compelling story.Rita was an awesome character. She's a take no s**t from no one kind of woman and when she realizes something's up in Hull's landing she won't stop until she figures it out. Her questioning of the locals puts her at odds with many of them, but she just keeps digging. And while I felt that she could handle herself towards the end I felt nervous for her because I kept feeling like she was going to push the wrong person and end up in a horrible situation.I really liked this one and I will personally be looking for more of Melzer's work. However I do have to warn that this book is not for the faint of heart and deals with a very mature subject matter. I can usually read any subject without having to step away from it, but this one is very strong. It's not offensive (at least I wasn't ""offended"") but it was hard to read.",4

B00EVAV70W,A3Q01J29CXK9V0,"11 27, 2013",What the Cat Read,Sweet romance read,"This novella was truly an enjoyable read, murr! Purrs and tail waves of Givens for a job well done.One thing that always worries me when it comes to novellas is whether or not the author is able to spin a well told story in a short number of pages. In the case of In Her Dreams, not only is the plot structured well, but the characters themselves are well-developed. Plus there&#8217;s enough romance, mystery, and even some humor to keep readers turning the pages in order to find out how everything is resolved.In the case of the plot, and without giving away any spoilers, Givens does an excellent job blending Evangeline&#8217;s reality and dreams together to the point where the reader starts to wonder just when does the dream become reality or is reality the dream? Even Evangeline herself questions her sanity regarding this at one point. At the same time, Givens use to historical details help to keep the plot realistic. A young woman of 20+ years bordering on being a spinster, an engagement build on the grounds of societal advancement and convenience rather than love, even parental scheming are all elements that help drive events within the novella and pull readers into the story. The one problem that I had with the plot, but loved at the same time due to its paranormal feel, was that I really wanted an explanation for Evangeline&#8217;s & Alexander&#8217;s dream connection. How was such a thing possible? I was more than happy with all of the answers to the various other questions I had within the text, but this one was left rather ambiguous. Still, the air of mystery it created certainly keep me interested, murr!What truly stood out for me in this novella though were the characters. I loved Evangeline. She knows exactly what she wants out of life, isn&#8217;t afraid to make her displeasure of things known, and is definitely a force to be reckoned with. In other words, she&#8217;s strong-willed. And while society, in the time the novella takes place, would think her actions as scandalous, I can&#8217;t help but smile and cheer her on. Meanwhile her sister, Angela, got under my fur at times. I do have to applaud her for playing the dutiful daughter and acquiescing to societal demands, but it wasn&#8217;t until the very end when she actually took control of her life and went after her heart&#8217;s desire that I really started to like her. Alexander was a dream, both figuratively and literally. I instantly liked him and enjoyed every scene that he was in. Those dream sequences&#8230;meow! Manchester on the other paw&#8230;okay, I have to agree with Evangeline&#8217;s opinion of him being an annoyance rather than a grand catch. And as far as Evangeline and Angela&#8217;s mother is concerned, all I will say about her is talk about a headache creator. Wow, she really is a piece of work&#8230;and yet rather common for that time period.To briefly touch upon the romance between Alexander and Evangeline, let me simply say that it is HOT! The scenes where they are together certainly will make you want to make muffins with your paws, murr! And as I mentioned earlier, the mystery behind their connection is intriguing. I&#8217;d loved it if Givens ever considered expanding on this story, but at the same time must admit that it is wonderful in its current form.I highly recommend fans of Historical Romance give this novel a try. And even those just looking for a fun, quick read, this novella is well worth adding to your TBR pile. =^.^=",4

B00JQWZOOU,A21CRF6SRA5TMS,"04 20, 2014",Nonni,Love vs infatuation,"Rose is a strong willed young woman who dreams of marrying her first true love, a distant relative named Oliver.  When she is told she is betrothed to a man 20 years her senior, a man she has never even met, she refuses.  However, learning that her marriage would keep her mother from the poorhouse, she submits but writes all her feelings and desires for Oliver down in her diary.  Lord Richard teaches her from the moment they enter his bedchamber on their wedding night that she is to follow any and every order she is given.  Rose learns he means what he says as he takes her across his lap and gives her a spanking before they even have consummated the marriage.  She is given rules to live by and pays the consequences for misbehavior.  Despite her determination to remain loyal in her heart to Oliver, she knows from the moment Richard claimed her that he has ignited feelings inside that she can't deny.  When he is arrested and faces possible death for his religious beliefs, she discovers that she was only infatuated with Oliver and that her entire heart and soul belong to her Lord.  The entire book is written as diary entries but is easy to follow.  I wish it had been longer and not end so abruptly but it does make for a quick, entertaining read.  If you like historical romance with spanking and a bit of age-play, you should like this one as well.",4

However, it adds a good amount of weight to the tablet, almost defeating all that engineering that got the HDX to be as light as it is. I think the OtterBox would be a great purchase if you're going to have kids use it; however, if you don't usually drop things and are careful, you can probably get away with a lighter case.Figuring out how to put the HDX in the OtterBox was a little confusing to me at first, but I eventually figured it out. The screen protector is a nice feature. I haven't used it a ton, so I don't know how it will hold up, but it appears to be very durable. The case itself looks like it will protect the HDX from anything.Overall, this case will definitely add more protection to your HDX. The only question is if the extra heft will make it worthwhile to you on a daily basis. It appears to do exactly what it intends to do by protecting the HDX.

Wanting to be an astronaut was a dream that he couldn't ignore if he wanted to seeing that the launch pad for the rockets and ships were only a mile or so from his backyard.Don't think that the book was solely about space and astronauts because Jessie was coming up in a very changing time that included the Vietnam War, the draft, integration, as well as the occasional bully or two or three. However, Jessie persevered through hardships and yes a few tragedies to make it to the end point of watching a man walk on the moon.I truly did love this read.

Drake wanted to be the older brother, the protector, and he felt that he had failed and he was trying to live with that; unfortunately he found his escape in the bottom of a Jack Daniels bottle. He also found solace in the beautiful Lana Daniels (interesting that she and Jack have the same last name, lol). Their story was sweet and heartbreaking. I felt so bad for Lana the ""morning after"", and I couldn't imagine how hurt she must have been and can understand why she felt the need to get away. I know that Emmie has such a strong bond and history with the guys, but I was a little disappointed in her responses (on several occasions) to Lana as it related to Drake. Thankfully, it all worked out in the end.  I enjoyed that we also got to see what is happening in the lives of the other band members and their loves.

I was always trying to guess what was coming next.  I couldn't believe how many different twists and turns he managed to pack into the story.  The suspense had me on the edge of my seat more than once.You cannot help but love the characters that you meet in this story.  They are simply looking for a way out of the situations that they have managed to get themselves into.  They are real people who exude real emotions, albeit in some rather uncanny circumstances.This is a very well written and well developed story.  The descriptions of people and places are very clear.  There are never any long, drawn out background parts in the story, however the reader knows all that they need to know to understand what is happening throughout the story.  This does not stop you from wishing that you know more or trying to guess what would happen next.  What would a suspense story be without those moments?Ray has a great deal of technological and military ops information in this novel as well.  The information included is not overly farfetched, but rather quite close to reality.  It aids greatly in the progression of the story.There was one instance in the novel that really got to me.  After sleeping on it, it is still on my mind so I feel that I should mention it.  One of the first things that the main characters did together they went to a wine tasting.  Once reunited, the characters end up at another wine tasting, however this time one of them is pregnant.  However, even with this blip, overall you really find yourself wondering what would happen if these events really took place.",4

In each installment, Sang grows closure to an individual or individuals of the group, she is faced with an unknown threat and must rise above the chaos that has become her life and together with the boys unravel the mystery and defeat the &#8220;bad guy/girl&#8221;. I really do find each story individually fascinating BUT I would really like a little more meat to the mystery behind the academy, its been 5 installments and we are still in the dark. I'd also like a little more into the back ground of the school leadership so I might find their actions plausible. I'm having a hard time reconciling some of the characters continued actions without more background. Please don't get me wrong, there is something about these books that have captured my attention...but if we don't get some sort of direction, I'm afraid I will loose that connection.There is something inherently fun watching all these boys/men vying for the attention of Sang. It has the same draw as an Anita Blake story less the copious amounts sex and paranormal tendencies...leaving us with a much cleaner, contemporary, romance, mystery wrapped into a young adult storyline.",4

Roger had been the one who had rescued him after his parents had been killed and given him a new identity to protect him from his parent's killers, thus making him T.D Waters from Clarkson.But if  the Clarksons were not his parents then who are his reals parents and why haven't they never contacted him?Why was he not told that he was adopted?Why is Collins adamant on discouraging him in his quest for the truth?He knows that he has to find out the truth of his parentage and the truth is at the Winchester Ranch!Elizabeth 'Lizzy' Calder is a fine detective and when Roger tells her to bring in the 'Rogue' detective T.D. Waters, she is more than ready to do her job. But what she has not anticipated is falling under his spell and ultimately questioning the truth of her directions from Roger Collins!Anne and Janie McCormick, heartbroken by their mother's imprisonment and bitter against the Winchesters are planning on doing something big on the wedding day but the question remainsAre they capable of something fatal and evil?How far are they willing to take this hatred and anger of theirs at harming the Winchesters?Can T.D bring out the years old skeletons from the closet, so to speak?Will McCall have a happy wedding at the Winchester Ranch or is it already set to doom?Although I felt that the love between T.D and Lizzy looked a bit hurried and could have been given more depth still I loved both these characters. Janie's character of a shrewd, conniving and a bit unstable person was expertly sketched and managed to chill the reader to their bones. I felt sorry for Anne who seemed lost after losing her mother and hoped for a happy ending for her too..I sincerely hoped that she would come closer to Hunt and would have loved if Hunt was given more say in the matter instead of keeping him behind the scenes with practically no presence in the story except for just a mention of his name by other characters!!The last book in the Winchester Ranch Series, Winchester Christmas Wedding, finally provides all the answers to us while it also opens and closes some new secrets. A very well wrapped series with satisfactory answers to all angles and a happy ending for all, I am finally at peace knowing that all is again well at the Winchester Ranch! :)Sweet 4 stars out of 5 to Winchester Christmas Wedding and kudos to B.J.

I like and don't like this.  I kind of wish that we got to see exactly what happened.Hunter's character in this story surprised me.  He seems kind of insecure about himself in ""Fearless"", but he always seemed so confident in Storm.  I thought he was so sure of himself and had plenty of confidence until reading this.

This is an emotionally charged story of two people far from perfection, and carrying a steamer trunk filled with sadness, guilt, a history of wrong decisions, and hardships.From the book blurb:Joseph &#8220;Havoc&#8221; Mariano is an enforcer for the Night Horde MC. He&#8217;s a punch first, think maybe kind of guy, a man of action. He's impatient and frustrated with the quiet life.Corinne Hawes is a single mother struggling to find a way to make a life for her and her teenage son, Nolan. She is an artist at heart, a free spirit on whom the structure and rigor of routine chafes hard.Havoc and Cory are brought together over work at the Valhalla Vin wine bar, and the chemistry between them moves from a slow smolder to a rapid fire, plagued with mishaps, misunderstandings, and a need to keep Cory&#8217;s son Nolan safe. All of the Horde members, their wives, children and several town folk help to tie the story together, with new appearances by Cory&#8217;s sister and husband, Cory ex, and Havoc&#8217;s family.The quite life the Horde has lived by for the last several years also takes a turn towards the side of danger, causing the members to question if they've made the right decisionThe story line continues to be well written and planned out, this book having some shocking moments, and some that were predictable.

B009SZNN5W,A341QXB22BZYYA,"10 31, 2012","Elf2060 ""Elf2060""",An entertaining young adult fantasy,"4 1/2 stars""Fox's Mask"" by Anna Frost is a delightful young adult story that follows the adventures of a samurai named Akakiba and his apprentice Yuki.  The two travel the countryside battling and eliminating demons even though Yuki is human and not a member of Akakiba's Fox Clan.  A remarkable series of events results in Yuki obtaining a new and complex companion even as he learns that there is far more to his enigmatic mentor than he ever dreamed.  The trio travel to the Fox Clan's home base and discover that there are two different enemies to be confronted, not to mention complex family issues that Akakiba has never revealed.  The life and death struggles will require fortitude and teamwork but the challenge will be to identify who the real enemy is.This was a beautifully written young adult fantasy that blends the elements of Japanese samurai and the mythology of the kitsune in a tale that is filled with delightful twists and turns.  The flowing imagery and the intriguing characters that are depicted make this a wonderful introduction to the series, `The Kitsune Trilogy'.  The author artfully combines familiar concepts such as shape-shifting and demon possession into a fresh new tale that entertains and educates and makes one curious to discover what new creature is going to appear and how it will fit into this fascinating world.  A very enjoyable read that will make one anxious for the next episode in the series. Night Owl ReviewsI had the great good fortune to win a copy of this lovely title.",4

B008TD33D6,ASLSCL3KWHFSE,"10 16, 2013",Future Slayer Girl (aka: kitten),Great taboo story with lots of heart...,"I have been slowly working my way through Jenika's back list. I started out with this series in parallel to her Virgin Auction series. To date I have loved more of her 'taboo' books. I feel like the heart in them in just pure. It is all those forbidden loves you hear about all the time and people are so judgey about. Yet they all work out in Jenika's world.I found this book as a whole to be my favorite. It is not more sexy than Lucie's book, however, I think the full circle themes in this book resonated more with me as a reader. I attached myself a lot more to Mona as a lead female. I felt like she was smart, strong, and her vulnerable moments were written so real that they made me want to cry for her. My impulse to save her and smack Issac was fierce. Only because his rational that Holly would make a better partner for him was literally the most male thing for him to do.The sex scenes were not as dominant for me in this book therefore I was able to connect with everyone and their dramas a lot better. I wasn't bored, and I read this in a few hours I believe.Great installment and it just proves that taboo erotica can be written classy and doesn't deserve any sort of 'ban' on it when written as beautifully as Jenika has.",4

Here is one interesting book. What I like in this one is that the writer is enthusiastic about writing. Hurray! So if there are a few construction mistakes in the book, who cares? The book carries its weight.Here comes a love story where the sexual attraction leads to deeper feelings, but the would-be couple is marred by fear, over-interpretation of facts, jealousy and heart-breaking lack of self-confidence. There is a (too short) psychological explanation in the past of the man, not enough for the female, but this is a lovely story. Anybody can find faults in the book (see other reviews), it is a first book. I could point out that in the beginning there is the requested sexual attraction but not enough of the other poles of attraction (both heroes have ethics and dreams) and that the business side of the male hero is not developed enough in the book to be well set. But it is all details. This book is enjoyable and you should keep watch for the next one.",4

I had to find out for myself what the buzz was all about. I'm glad I did. I'm a sucker for white hot man on man action and Asa and Lachlan are super hot. I felt like I was right there with them and had to know what would happen next.Both are strong men and I couldn't help but smile when they met. Okay, so it wasn't the most marshmallowy sweet meeting. That's fine. I loved reading about them learning each other and having red-hot sex.There were a couple of issues. I found myself more than once being pulled from the story because there was a good deal of telling rather than showing. As much as I felt like I was there, I didn't feel like I was in the characters' shoes. I also wanted to get into the characters' heads more than I did. But, it didn't keep me from enjoying the book. Far from it.The action-packed plot has twists and turns I didn't see coming and I'm glad.

Stay is easily able to be read alone as Cooper and Noah from book 1 are minor secondary characters in Stay.Stay opens where book 1 left off with Wes dealing with the loss of his sister and being left to care for his niece Jessie.I wanted to pause and say I loved Jessie; this little girl offered such a range of emotions for the readers; there is a Christmas Eve scene that broken my heart and reminded me how deeply loss affects people even when they have a smile on their face.Wes is tasked with caring for his niece and with building a new life in a new city despite having a one night stand with Braden, Wes is very clear he wants no part of a relationship as he does not feel he can handle one given his new responsibilities. The battle Wes has in his own head often made me feel bad for him.Braden was funny, witty and very determined; he was such an enjoyable character to read. Braden proves to Wes and the reader that he knows what it means to be friend.As I watched the chemistry between these two men develop, I found myself loving the underlying friendship Wes and Braden developed. Moving comfortably in each others spaces, supporting each other and in the end relying on each other spoke volumes to what a future could look like for them.I should also say I loved the scenes with Braden&#8217;s family; his parents were a trip and the scenes with his siblings and their families made for some wonderful character interactions and allowed the reader a deeper understanding of Braden.Ok I would remise if I did not say that the sex between these two was hot.. as Braden slowly breaks the walls Wes&#8217; puts around himself the heat builds and then develops into something more, something the reader feels.The question becomes as these men grow together without putting labels on things; what happens when opportunity calls.. No, I am not telling you.. you will need to read the book to find out.I am so very pleased that we are able to bring you the bonus scene on this page as Stay left me wanting a bit more so I hope you enjoy a little more Wes, Braden and Jessie AFTER you read Stay!",4

I worry it won't be as good as I think it will - or time and space has dulled my initial enthusiasm. Whatever the case this one was different than I expected but it met my expectations. Hows that for confusing?The blurb describes it well so no rehash here. I found this one totally ruled by its characters. If I had to use a word to describe Alex it would be More . More sex, more rough, more pain, more - more-more. He is steel underneath - his is the strength. Gavin, as his trainer, spends much of his time not so sure. Not so sure of what he wants, what Alex needs, and unsure of how this whole thing is going to work out. He actually irritated me quite frequently. Sam, Gavin's partner, I really wanted more exploration of. Demetri says something to him during a lunch (no spoilers) and I was right there with him wondering the same thing. It is an unanswered question and the reason for the loss of a star. I felt it needed to be answered by more than just Sam and Gavin's love - I didn't believe it. How's that for cryptic?I also (if I'm truthful) wanted more exploration of the other slave training facilities. Here at Cascade it was so insular. I felt like it was a very separate part of the world. It made the society at large feel sheltered and a lot less harsh and realistic than I expect it truly is. Sort of like Hogwart's where it might be magical inside but outside you just know there are creepy things in black ready to suck out your soul.So glad I finally read it (3+ years on the TBR) and pretty happy with it. Much sweeter than I normally read when reading any sort of slave fiction - so those who get scared off by my normal reading list should give this a try. It is an excellent exploration of BDSM in a controlled environment - with some great scenes.",4

At the time of reading I was surprised, in hind sight; I can see where the author wanted to build the history as to how the situation came to be.  Annie is a loner, stuck in a Goth phase but let&#8217;s face it she uses it as an emotional cover-up or crutch.  She has only one friend, her roommate Corinne.  Corinne is almost the antithesis of Annie with her pinup looks, extroverted personality, and often wild behavior.  Annie prefers to be the wallflower.  After a less than ideal situation and fight with Corinne, she realizes she&#8217;s simply been sad and lonely for a long time.  Thrusting her entire life aside, she thrown caution to the wind and makes an abrupt and life altering change.Brendan has had his heart shattered by his long-term girlfriend.  He had doted over her for many years, choosing to ignore the womanizing ways of his closest friends.  The only thing he ever wanted was to make Sara happy.  Even when she up and moved across the country, Brendan was still crafting ways to make their relationship work.  It wasn&#8217;t until she revealed she&#8217;s engaged to someone else did he figure out they were over.  It was then he snapped and began to rethink he previously committed ways.  He wondered why he&#8217;d been so respectful to her and in turn all women when they weren&#8217;t deserving of it.  All he could see was the pain women caused the men around him.  With this in mind, he sets about drastically revolutionizing his approach to women and decides it&#8217;s time to be like his friends, just having a string of one night stands without emotion involved.  It&#8217;s then he makes some less than ideal decisions, but it&#8217;s those choices which lead his  and Annie&#8217;s paths to cross&#8212;just not in the way you&#8217;d expect.There are a couple of major points to you&#8217;ll want to remember while reading this story.  First, it is the initial installment of a new series from Sabrina Lacey.  Just when I thought I figured out what direction the plot was heading, I realized I was halfway through but there was no way it could finish in the portion that was left.  Fortunately, I passed my blonde moment and remembered it&#8217;s just the first part.  Secondly, any preconceived notions you have from reading the synopsis, just get rid of them.  Situations kept occurring that made me angry, confusing me as to how this could possibly have any type of HEA; it broke girl code more than once.  While reading I was cringing and want to get past the train wreck of situations that happen. Hold tight, by the conclusion of this first part there is light at the end of the tunnel.In the end, after getting through it, I can see the validity of those not so great scenarios and see the bigger picture forming.  While this may not have been the pleasant read I expected, stick with it because it&#8217;s interesting and intriguing.  By the time I finished this first installment I wanted to have the second.  This is definitely one of those times I curse the series gods for not having part 2 readily available.  I want more, I need more.Rating:  3.75 Stars~Complimentary copy received in exchange for honest review.~",4

Ian acts like a man child all over the place and Miro bitches about two things; how often he gets hurt while working with Ian and how often his expensive clothes get ruined while he is on the job. These character flaws are played for humor. It is hard to take the story seriously with these characteristics when we are told Ian is supposed to be a tough guy and Miro is supposed to be the &#34;smart one.&#34; I gave this book four stars though. I enjoyed how there wasn't much plot beyond the romantic aspect. The rest of the happenings in the book were more a slice-of-life perspective. The escorting prisoners and capturing of bad guys is treated as background, you'll-never-believe-what-happened-at-work-today incidentals. This style works for this book. Ian and Miro's chemistry is great. The man-child antics, the clothes-horse grumbling and the witty dialog are amusing. If you are looking for a light, sweet read with guns, I'd get this book.",4

I could almost hear his voice.Parker brings us this delightful tale with a seasoned storyteller feel. Reminiscing on a childhood prank, Randall always thought the spooky words spoken by the scary recipient of the prank performed by the hands of his friend were directed at him. As the story unfolds, we learn they may have been spoken for his friend. As time passes, his buddy Justin appears to be haunted by the events of that day in a way Randall was not. I do look forward to seeing how this all unfolds in the next part of the saga.Beyond the witch, this story tells of the pain and suffering two adolescent boys experience as their parents divorce. It is interesting how Parker crafts this story, relating events to the encounter with the old woman, or witch. I was looking for something, but can't really say what. I feel the saga has great potential as the gaps are filled in part 2.Overall, this was a quick read which kept me interested and left me wanting more.",4

Other than this it was a sweet story.The second one would have been better if Opal hadn't whined so much and tried too hard to make Nebraska fit her way of life. The children were the best part.

B00BS25GM6,A3P4BJ6GBH7KIW,"10 29, 2013",Becky C,4 1/2 stars from Madam Aus,"I loved this, the second book in Patrician Logan&#8217;s Aramdillo Series, but I think I am in love with the men from Westburg. It can be read as a stand-alone book ,as the story is completely encapsulated and does not bleed from one book to the next , the only thing tying these books are the characters, who are introduced in one, or appear throughout the series. So when Undercover Nights starts, we have met both Cody and Gage in Leather Nights but they haven&#8217;t met each other yet.I will not reiterate the blurb because if you are like me you have read it all already, and it is good, covering the main points, enticing you. The story line is great, there is tension and anticipation built thoughout the whole book, again, ending quite satisfactorily in a big climax. This arc pushes Cody and Gages relationship along at quite a nice pace and the suspense is less of a whodunit and more of a how-are-they-gonna-prove-Gage-didn&#8217;t-do-it. There is no doubt who is involved but how they are entwined is one of the unraveling story lines.I love the interaction between the MC&#8217;s, Patricia writes with a sense of humour that just tickles my fancy and I find myself sniggering, snorting and guffawing in the most inappropriate places (like at work!!). There were a few things that niggled at me, which is why the 4  rating. There were a few decisions that Cody made that I wasn&#8217;t sure about, I suppose I would have wanted just a bit more of Cody&#8217;s decision making process within the narrative. Mind you it all worked out well and you understood the why, but there were things set up for Cody that could have been expanded on (not a whole lot or then it would be too much). That could just be me but there you have it.The hotness of these two is again off the scale, (I seriously don&#8217;t think that Patricia can write an MC that isn&#8217;t hot as hell.) Also the sweetness and honesty come through, once again highlighting just how smexy that combination can be. The scene when Cody explains his &#8220;baggage&#8221; (which is quite heavy and could be a trigger for some) was beyond enthralling and I was mesmerized from the start, the trust he puts in Gage, and Gages ability to read him, was awe-inspiring. There is still a fair amount of sex talk but this is actually a bit quieter than the other two, which is fitting for these two MC&#8217;s.I loved it as you can probably tell. I might just put them on my to visit (in my dreams) list. Gage and Cody and the ongoing characters of Westburg and the FBI continue to pull me back in, and it is a good second installment of this series&#8230;.",4

The world is divided between on one side the Reapers (or zombies), and on the other side the humans, themselves separated in several groups: the residents of the mountain cities, who have financial and technical means, the residents of the plains, mainly farmers, and the Rangers, some kind of Cavalry immune to the reaper parasite. I loved that original universe, well thought and well written, which includes cowboys, zombies, airship, and other technology verging on steampunk.I really liked Abby. Even if she&#8217;s been a Ranger for several years, she&#8217;s not hard and insensitive, quite the opposite. She&#8217;s also open-minded enough to end up accepting the world is not in black and white like she thought. In fact we could mainly reproach her for being a little too reckless, even if I thought her reactions could be logical given the context.Jake is a very interesting character too. He fights his parasite to control it; he has remorse about his past acts or his actual decisions. I liked how he feels helpless and disconcerted in front of Abby and the unknown feelings she awakes in him. His wish to find a cure and what he&#8217;s ready to undergo for this quest are understandable when we imagine everything he&#8217;s lived.You&#8217;ll have understood, I was really won over by the universe and I loved the story.

Yes, cops need love too. We know attractive, single docs are going to get some play so I was happy to see that the protagonist and heroine is a strong, beautiful woman who just happens to carry a gun.  Rest assured this is no simpering, silly Sally just pretending to chase bad guys, Danny is the real deal. She has a tough exterior, but I liked that the author showed her sensitive side when her relationship with Jake reconnects her to her spiritual roots. I enjoyed the vet/PTSD angle brought to life by Dr Jake. He is a well rounded character that is brawny but has a vulnerability that is believable and relatable.  Believing Again is book 5 in the Second Chances series and while it is a stand alone there is some cross over. Her partner, Sam, is a hold over from Loving Again and the banter between the two provides believable back story.Believing Again does lose a bit of steam when it delves into the police investigation side. I found Jake's active involvement into Danny's work unbelievable. I know his work with the homeless vets was meant to provide cover into why he would be at an active crime scene, but cautioning your not quite girlfriend, who happens to be a police detective, into why she shouldn't be going places alone is a bit of a stretch. Despite being a plot point, I don't think anyone with any common sense (let alone a badge) would invite a witness into her home. Also not calling for back up is a big no no and unrealistic to boot. Because this is a romantic suspense novella I was expecting a to see the whodunit play out more rather than a sum up report at the end.  In spite of is formulaic nature I enjoyed Believing Again and will definitely check out more from this series.",4

I was familiar with Shay as an author, but had never read any of her stories until now.  I just may read more.  Honestly, I love history, but reading something so far back as Roman times has never really interested me.  I'll watch a movie or TV, but a story is going to be a hard sell.  But, Shay Savage accomplished quite a bit in such a short span of time to get my attention and to find the worth of a slave girl and a Roman god that has been injured while fighting.  It was written quite lovely and I liked the flow of it.  I've heard she writes a mean sex scene, but that wasn't really included in here.  Just a bit to leave you wanting more.

B00HY03FVU,A18A8LAO5H14LY,"02 19, 2014",Stephanie Harper,It was like I was living my own rockstar dream through Olivia!,"4 Stars!!Oh Olivia Bloom how I envy you. I knew from the minute I read the synopsis of this book that I would enjoy it and I did! How could I not love this book? It has a swoon worthy rockstar, two witty best friends, a normal girl who gets the guy, and paparazzi. Paparrazzi you say? Why yes I do, I love trash magazines and this book fed my habit.Olivia Bloom left Pittsburgh on a journey to be free. She heads to L.A. on an adventure of a lifetime. I wish I had the guts that Olivia had. After a bad break up she leaves everything in hopes of a new life, and she succeeds. Olivia lives at The Vicente and befriends two great people, Blaire and Parker. Every time the three of them would sit in the courtyard for a glass of wine all I could picture was the courtyard setting from Melrose Place. Please tell me you remember Melrose Place, no? Man I feel old. Olivia lands a one time job thanks to the help of Blaire, where she is dressing the models for a fashion show. She feels completely out of her element and vacates the party as soon as she can. But not without a stop at the restrooms on her way out. That stop would change her life, only she has no clue. Waiting for the restroom to open up she sees Berkeley Dalton, lead singer of Berkeley  & the Brightside, her favorite band. Of course she makes a fool out of herself but that is what I love about Olivia, she is normal. She is not your perfectly beautiful girl who always says the right thing and acts the right way. She reacted the same way I would have; inside she is full on fan-girling all while speaking without thinking. I honestly felt awkward for her.Parker and Blaire decide that Olivia needs a complete overhaul and &#34;Operation Loverly&#34; goes into full effect. Parker and Blaire cracked me up yet they were on top of their game. Olivia soon becomes a polished socialite all while never changing who she really was. She continued to be quirky and normal. I think that is why I connected with the book so much, I could relate to her.Berkeley Dalton, oh my my. I was little worried in the beginning I wasn't going to fall for this lead singer rock star. I was wrong, so wrong. I am glad I didn't fall right away and that I grew to love him. It makes me love him all that much more. He turned out to be everything I originally thought he wasn't. He is sweet, caring, mysterious, and sexy all rolled into one. His lyrics are beautiful and they come from the heart.I loved that Olivia was so infatuated with Berkeley from the beginning. That she was a huge fan of the band and their music had helped her through college and every major event in her life. It was like I was living out my own dream of meeting and dating my favorite rock star. Who hasn't had that dream? Would I want all the paparazzi issues that follow? Absolutely not. Katie does a great job of making this book realistic. It is not over the top and I loved that. I loved just about everything in this book. There is no insta-love in this book, infatuation yes, but no insta-love. Their relationship grows slowly and at times it is growing and we don't even know about it. I loved learning little secretes here and there.I think one of my favorite parts of this book is the tweets. All of the characters tweet, reading them and knowing their thoughts made this book so much better. I laughed so many times throughout this book.The one thing I didn't love was the ending. It seemed a little rushed to me. There was an entire book of build up and then all of a sudden something major happens and it is over. I understand that this is book one in the series but I still felt it was a rushed ending. The epilogue didn't really seem like an epilogue to me, it just seemed like an additional chapter that would have played out next in the book anyway. I am interested in seeing who book two is about. Do we get more Olivia and Berkeley or are Parker and Blaire getting their own books? I stalk goodreads every day to see if Katie has updated and added the second book in the series. As of this posting she hasn't. Katie, are you listening? Yes? Great! GO UPDATE GOODREADS! I NEED to know what the next books are about. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in this series and see what else is in store for the characters I have grown so attached to.",4

It's a cute, romantic story about a woman needing a date for her sister's wedding. Alice wants a handsome man to pose as her boyfriend to make her jerk of an ex regret cheating on her. Her sexy neighbor seems like the perfect guy, she just doesn't realize that he's a vampire.Noah doesn't think it's a good idea. The wedding is on a cruise ship which means he will be spending a week surrounded by humans. On the other hand, he needs to get out of town for awhile to avoid an arranged vampire bonding ceremony. He reluctantly decides to take Alice up on her offer, though they are very different people. Alice is so bright and perky. Noah is more reserved and is a bit of a grump - at first anyway. Their blend of personalities turned this into a charming story. Alice's family added some humor and charm as well.There is a lot of sexual tension between these two characters. They've been attracted to each other for years, even though they haven't really known one another. Now, they're both single and pretending that they are a couple so the sparks are bound to happen. The love scenes are hot and steamy, so I don't recommend it to young readers. If you're looking for a light, fun, romantic story with a happily-ever-after, then this is the book for you!",4

B00J048MRK,A3UPJZ5RIIJJ6M,"04 4, 2014",JC @ All is Read,Solid debut!,"This is a pretty solid debut novel, I couldn&#8217;t give it 5 stars as I had some minor issues with some of the plot but I will go into that a bit later.In Ahead of Darkness we first meet Mia (Amelia) on her way to a new life, one of many that she has had to create over the years. Right away we aware that she is running from someone, that someone being her Papa.Mia creates a new life for herself and does the best she can to avoid any lasting connections or relationships with people until that is she meets Drew. The sexy, well-to-do Scotsman who owns the club Cascades. Soon Mia finds herself captivated by Drew and spending all of her time with him. Their relationship begins to develop into something more and we see Mia begin to struggle with allowing herself to feel what she wants for Drew and protecting herself from losing someone she cares deeply for.Throughout the story we get snippets of Mia&#8217;s past and boy are they frightening, her memories were both terrifying and disturbing, stuff that nightmares are totally made of. Drew becomes her ever steady rock as she comes to reveal some of her past to him and you can&#8217;t help but fall head over heels, tumbling down a cliff, into a pool of love and lust for him. He is the complete package, caring, vigilant, protective and bloody hell he is sexy with his Scottish brogue and all. There are some steamy scenes between him and Mia but they are balanced with some truly tender and vulnerable moments and I loved that. There is also a lot of comedic banter between Drew and Mia that will have you literally laughing out loud. Both characters play on each other so well. The story was definitely suspenseful and kept me entertained but&#8230;.Now here is where I complain and again some of these are minor and could possibly be something that is planned for the second book so here goes. Questions, questions, questions, I have so many questions about both Mia&#8217;s past and Drew&#8217;s. They are a lot of holes that were left unfilled in this first book. Granted again maybe the plan is to reveal more in the second book but I think it would have been better to approach the first book with intent to build a strong back story for both Mia and Drew. There were inklings I got suggesting there was a lot more to Drew then was revealed and it kept bugging me like an itch I couldn&#8217;t scratch. Next I wasn&#8217;t so happy with how (and I will avoid spoilers) the events unfolded at the end, it felt too rushed everything happened like a whirlwind and then we were left with this cliffhanger that almost made me scream. Considering this is a series I didn&#8217;t understand why more time wasn&#8217;t spent on this particular aspect of the story, why the rush?Overall I enjoyed Ahead of Darkness and I feel the series is off to a good start, I am hoping a lot of the questions I have will be answered in the second book and I definitely intend to read it.*received gifted copy",4

B00JKMLD8M,A27E2JFW956S2H,"04 29, 2014",Hot Stuff Book Reviews,A good addition to the Rock Stars novels out there.,"I received this book via Netgalley for an honest review.To be honest, I still wonder how I never heard about this one before I saw it on Netgalley. I mean, I am a sucker for rock stars and this one doesn&#8217;t disappoint.This book doesn&#8217;t bring anything new and uses the same tropes these books often use, but they work perfectly mostly because all the characters are perfectly portrayed here. When you have well-portrayed characters, everything will flow better, and in no time you&#8217;ll delve into the story.But, I didn&#8217;t delve in the story right away because there are many characters and sometimes it was difficult to follow who was talking to who, but after a couple of chapters things got easier.Deacon is really a great male lead character. I warmed up to him right away even though his attraction to Harper feels almost too much like love at first sight, which got me worried for a while. Usually, I hate it when the characters get close fast, but the authors here made it easy, mostly because of the settings. After all, we don&#8217;t know what happens during rock tours! ;)Harper is an interesting female character and she didn&#8217;t annoy me contrary to what many female characters have done these past few weeks. Though, I would have loved to see more of how her past, how the way she&#8217;s been raised could have truly jeopardized her relationship with Deacon. In this instance, I never truly saw it or believed it.And the same goes with Deacon. Somehow, his troubled past is too &#8220;down-played&#8221;. He&#8217;s young and his tough life should have let a bigger scar on him which should have resulted in some hang-ups. Unfortunately, there are more sex scenes &#8212;very well written&#8212; than actual conflicts.It&#8217;s a pleasant read, one you should read if you enjoy Contemporary Romance novels with rock stars, because you&#8217;ll love the dynamic of the band Oblivion. In fact, I look forward to reading the next installment.",4
B004AE3N7O,A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP,"01 3, 2011","Robert Carnevali ""Typical, middle-aged guy""","A nice, but not quite as compelling, sequel","Using Amazon's rating system, I give this almost four stars as I liked it quite a bit.In ""An Earlier Heaven"", Jerry wound up with custody of his cousin's quiet, emotionally-withdrawn child when William's parents were suddenly killed. Being a loner who lives for creating art and engaging in anonymous sex, Jerry is very much upset. But one look at the shy, frightened William and Jerry knew that this child would be a part of his life. Little did he expect that he would fall for David, William's teacher, and in a few months, he'd have an entire family!""Good to Know"" was a nicely compelling romance where not only do the two lost souls meet and become a couple, but an entire family was created. ""An Earlier Heaven"" picks up shortly afterward. It's a family drama, not a romance, because romance has already been established by the time the story picks up. Here, William is doing well in school and has even take to sports. The only thing he doesn't seem to be doing is making friends. He does have a non-romantic crush on an older student whom he admires, and the older Cory is very caring towards William, treating him like a younger brother. But Cory seems to come from a troubled home, and as these two men incorporate Cory into their life, they wonder if Cory's troubles will eventually hurt William and if they should be doing something about it.Characters are nicely developed, the plot moves along, and the settings are realistic and organic. Dialog is crisp, and there are some very heartwarming moments. It's a very enjoyable read. The only drawback is that ""Good to Know"" was a very compelling romantic tale of the coming-together of a family, and this.... isn't quite that. Yes, there's the possibility that Cory will expand their family in some way, but the obstacles faced aren't as severe as in the first tale. There, the men had to battle with their own demons to admit their love for each other. Here, it's some external forces which don't quite seem as compelling. A slight focus on brand-names within the story distracts a little bit during that scene and seems almost like product-placement, but doesn't hurt the story overall.In essence, this story balances between illustrating the pains and foibles of raising a young child, and helping another child in his time of need.It's a nice, warm tale. If you enjoyed the first book, then you should enjoy this one. It moves the characters further along and makes you a part of their family, with all of the good and bad.",4

Faltys ""Joder""",Emotionally Draining With a Storyline That Draws You In Completely,"The path to a HEA is never easy as evidenced by the turmoil between Eric and Nick after his mother's death turns Eric's world upside down and has him looking for revenge.  This second book in the Courtland Chronicles picks up a few months after the previous installment and immediately has Eric pulling away from the one man to accept him fully to forge his vengeful pact with fellow businessman, Bran.  Even though Nick wants to support him, Eric wants to wallow in solitude.  Because things haven't turned out like he thinks they should have, Eric thinks he deserves to be punished.  And oh the punishments he endures at the hands of Bran!Bran and Eric are toxic together.  Their sexual interactions are graphic and degrading and Eric both loathes these moments and craves them. Bran uses him on every level as a means to an end and Eric's self-loathing allows it.  I felt such sympathy for Eric throughout the story. No matter how much he hurt Nick (and made me angry at him), he hurt himself more.  It's not until virtually the end of the story that Eric climbs out of his downward spiral and for the time being he and Nick have again acheived a HEA.Cat Grant has written another gutwrenching story and shown Eric at both his best and worst moments. Though we don't see much of Nick in the physical sense, his goodness and unquestionable loyalty permeates this story.  Through most of the story there's a sense of sadness and pain that the reader knows won't end well for Eric if he continues on his vengeful path.  Nick's reappearance at the end is like a sunrise. The unrelenting pain fades away as he and Eric reconnect. This series continues to keep me enthralled and these glimpses into their lives is like being on an emotional rollercoaster.  With its fully fleshed-out characters and heartwrenching situations I've become fully immersed in the outcome of Nick and Eric's lives and look forward to the next installment in this well-written and satisfying series.",4

I remained that way throughout the story, it was easy to get to know and grow to like all these characters as they were written so well. I didn't put this book down until I was finished I have to say the one thing that disappointed me when reading this book was the ending. So much time was spent at the beginning that I felt the end was entirely too rushed. I don't really want to say a whole lot and ruin it but when the big thing happens and the book ends just a few pages later for me it's jus too fast. I liked that there was an Epi but I still feel like too much was left out and the end and I want more.Just throwing this out there that I didn't read the first two books because I thought this was the first, and I wasn't lost. Also I wonder why Amazon does number the books in series I must be spoiled by Goodreads.",4

Meantime Luke is busy attempting to show Ned this job is just too big for him. Not to disappoint, Seton gives us a sweet romance to grab our attention. She really thinks out of the box on this and gives our main female character a non-stereotypical background. Fila, saw the Taliban murder her parents and spent 10 years as their prisoner. Not only that she managed to escape. Now fear and bad memories torment her. Ned thinks he is just the man to love her back to a healthly place.The story has a good plot, flows well and has a good pace once we get past first few chapters. Character development was well done making the reader want to get to know each one. Seton's writing style is descriptive and easy to follow.I did struggle with Fila's living alone with Ned. Just did not seem realistic due to her culture, her past 10 years, her fears and her stuggles to cope. I did very much like her and Ned together and saw many positive relationship lessons to be gleaned there. As well as a sweet love story.I would recommend this to anyone enjoying romanctic fiction.

I love free books, have I ever mentioned that? Here's the thing, though, just because it's free doesn't mean I have to like it. But....I happened to love 3:AM KISSES. This book was fun, sweet and sexy. I'm talking laugh-out-loud funny. Sugary sweet. Cinnamon Fireball hot. There isn't a thing I disliked about this book.Being in Baya's head is a hoot! Addison Moore is one funny woman. I don't know how she managed to come up with some of the phrases she did. It is possible that she may just have a secret book of naughty sayings. If she doesn't then I would suggest that she write that book herself. Sometimes I got a little giggle, maybe a chuckle, but there were certainly some hearty laughs in there. Addison doesn't even make us wait for the good stuff, she rocks it from chapter one and doesn't let up.I'm sure Bryson will find his way onto many 2013 ""Book Boyfriend"" lists. His character surprised me. There were a few times while reading that I was sure I had him pegged. Turns out I was completely incorrect on all fronts. I dare you to make your own assumptions. I'm willing to bet you will be wrong as well. In a readers world where too often all our men seem to blur together I found this to be a relief.The handful of supporting characters were perfectly thought out. I got the sense that Ms. Moore put a good deal of work to make sure they were just right. Everyone from Jeanie to Holt were exactly what the story, and the main characters, needed them to be. Not one could be considered arbitrary, and you'll be surprised who is actually of importance.I enjoyed each minute spent reading 3:AM KISSES. In fact, this is the first of Addison Moore's books that I've read, but will not be my last. I do believe I will begin her Young Adult series, Celestra, in the very near future.",4

B00DJQYAXK,A3326UC548HDXO,"11 23, 2013",Harlequin Junkie Blog,4.5 Stars Review!,"The Dysfunctional Test by Kelly Moran is a really good novel. The story is a wonderful combination of love, angst, and honesty.In just one day, Camryn Covic's life of contentment comes to a screeching halt. Her job is eliminated, her robotic boyfriend dumps her, and her apartment lease is not renewed. To make matters even worse, she has to tell her crazy family that she has no date for her sister's wedding in Colorado at the end of the week, which in their eyes is a major faux pas. Whoa, that's a lot for one person to handle!Luckily Camryn is an unbelievably strong woman. She is able to put up with her family's harassment, her ex-boyfriend's unkind words and her Nana's voice of tyranny. How she keeps it together is beyond me, because if this were my family, I would have disowned them the minute I was physically and financially able. Due to Ms. Moran's intelligent character and story development, I felt Camryn's every hurt as if it was my own, and got angry, teared up and sobbed on her behalf.Emily, Camryn's three year old niece is an absolute riot. She has a fabulous memory and remembers every adult word ever spoken and repeats them to others in no particular order whenever the mood strikes her. I just couldn't stop laughing! Emily always makes sure she is in the &#34;know&#34; and hangs on to all inappropriate verbiage in order to innocently embarrass members of her family. &#34;Can I have some cockporn please&#34; is a prime example.Thank goodness Troy Lanske was fostered by the Covic's for a good portion of his childhood. He is treated like a member of the family and Camryn's brother Fisher is his best friend. So when Camryn asks him to be her fake boyfriend for the wedding, he reluctantly agrees. Camryn believes that convincing her family that she and Troy are a couple is easier than dealing with their constant pestering about being dateless.The progression of Camryn and Troy's relationship is inspiring as well as sexy. They are two people that are truly destined to be together.I really liked this emotional, well-written novel. The story is a little lengthy, but the characters are amazingly real, likeable and well conceived. Ms. Moran's words grab you from the very first line and never let go. I highly recommend this book!",4

Now that she is engaged she has to learn to adjust to a privileged life style.  She also has to figure out how to live with Drew's secretive job and life.  Can she accept not really knowing what he is doing?  Will she be ok with him being gone traveling all the time?Shoshana , or Sho, also has to figure out her true feelings.  Her feelings for another man are growing and he has returned those feelings, but can she walk away from Drew for this other man.  She knows it would shatter the lives of both men and her own future.When I picked up this 600 page novel, I was a little apprehensive.  Thinking wow that is a lot of reading.  Now that I am done with the novel I wish there was more, a lot more.  I loved that this was a story of family, in-laws, and love.  Drew's mother, Birdie, and all his brothers and sister-in-laws all accepted Sho, even with her not being as wealthy and glamorous as the rest of them.  I loved that they did not judge her and actually too her under their wings, showing her the hows of the Walsh Family.  I feel like Sho was tougher and more critical of herself that anyone else in the family was.Drew, the fianc&eacute;e, was a character I had a hard time with.  All his secrets and seemingly uncaring responses to Sho made me shake my head and wish for something more for Sho.  His wealth, high profile job, and influential family make him seem like the perfect catch, but I am still not convinced their marriage will last.Finally, the ending of the novel...All I can say is so not expected.  But I am happy to report that the author is going to give me more.  Another novel about the Walsh's is in the works.  Do not pass up the opportunity to read this novel.  You will not regret the time you spend reading Becoming Mrs. Walsh.",4

Why would that even be an issue for the man since he is supposed to be a God fearing man?There were a lot of changes for Darcy and Shelley that happened before they even knew that they had or remembered that they had the tickets.  Shelley's husband was already trying to come back, the doctor was already in love with Darcy and Daisy just needed to come to terms with her past.

B00IAFNJVY,A186OVFN6N8QQ,"03 6, 2014",Roz @ My Written Romance,Definitely a keeper!,"I read this book over a couple of days, thanks mainly to the antics of my own little budding felon. There is something deliciously and delightfully off-kilter about Ros Baxter's heroines. Like Rania in Fish Out of Water, Lola just has that something different, and I love that.----Gosh, this was such a lot of fun to read. Right from the opening scene, and all the way through the story, I just knew I would love Lola.Whip-smart, passionate about the things that matter, headstrong, and with a penchant for impractical underwear, Lola lives a life in full Technicolor. I loved that she was scary-smart, yet not socially inept. I loved that her passion and commitment to social justice was both her great strength and her downfall (hence the semi-regular encounters with New York's finest). Her heart is always in the right place, even though she may not always execute the plan properly or think it through.Even though you don't see a hell of a lot of Wayne physically throughout the book, I love that connection they share. In the fleeting moments that they share throughout the course of the fifteen years, you are hit with a sense that there is something electric between them.Lola sure does get herself into some interesting pickles over the journey, and the people that inhabit her world, from Wayne to her militant romance-writing sister, from her gay Marine lawyer brother and his perpetually upbeat partner to a Japanese Brad Pitt clone, are there to support her and add a real brightness and colour to the story.I can see what people might find a little disjointing about the style of the narrative in Lingerie for Felons - Lola's story is told in a mixture of present time and flashbacks. Personally, I loved this. Lola's life is one full of up and downs and changes, and this approach fits so well with that.Ros Baxter has created yet another brilliant, fascinating story with colourful, interesting characters, real humour and emotion. Definitely a keeper!My rating: 4.5 out of 5Note: I was provided with an advanced reader copy of this book by Escape Publishing via NetGalley in return for an honest review.",4

The story is full of humorous dialogue and the chemistry between Christopher and Alannah is HOT!! I love that Ms. Bell made Christopher work in order to get Alannah attention. It wasn't love at first sight, but hey it worked for me.Christopher Beckett is not only a werewolf but a Wizard. Tired of being alone he cast a spell to find his one true mate, but when he finds her she is not who you expected. Christopher is more worried about his mate being prejudice to the fact that he's a werewolf,but when he finds his mate she is not what he expected.Alannah Evans is a witch, but not just any witch she is from one of the most powerful witch families. Not expecting to be the mate of a werewolf but on top of that he's a WIZARD (Cue in dramatic music) Alannah has to learn to deal with the fact that Chris is her mate but also her enemy.We are taking to a world full of magic, love and HOT HOT HOT HOT sex scenes. I have to say I've never read a book where the werewolf is also a wizard but I love the concept. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something different but with an amazing story. Also there's Witches, Wizards, and Warlock. Warlocks scare the crap out of me and of course in this series, the warlocks are BAD.

She is delivering towels to his hotel room, normal right? He is expecting a high priced call girl, dressed like a maid, not so normal. When Carmen comes in to drop off his towels he startles her, she wasn't expecting anyone to be there. He's ready to get down to business and likes what he sees in her. When he starts hitting on her, trying to get a feel of things, she decides that she likes his advances and chalks it up to being on her own for so long. I found this part quite funny. Carmen was trying not to seem too willing but when Kurt went in for a kiss, she threw all her inhibitions out the window. She didn't even mean to give him her real name. Too little, too late. Kurt doesn't seem like her ex though. Even though he is dominant, he is very gentle. They both end of having the time of their lives and in this afternoon they see in each other what they would like for their future. The sex is explosive and their conversations filled with humor. All good things must come to an end though. And that happens when the call girl dressed as a maid comes in asking if they were supposed to have a threesome! Carmen is humiliated and runs out the door and away from a very confused and upset Kurt.Carmen has been on the run for a while now. She managed to escape a very abusive man. He took her submissiveness to the extreme and kidnapped her, chained her up and locked her in a cage. She was badly beaten and became very ill during this time. After her escape, she created a new name and a new life. Now she's afraid it will all be for nothing. While Kurt has been searching for Carmen, so has her ex. She isn't left with many options but finally decides she needs to call Kurt for help. She really just wants to talk with him. She knows they had a connection and really wants to see him again. Kurt is thrilled she's called. He will do whatever possible to help her. He wants her as his own but the situation she has gotten herself in needs to be settled first.There is so much more to this story but I don't want to give too much away! So many elements are dealt with in Carmen and Kurt's story. Brutal and dark take up much of the second part of the story. But there is also healing, acceptance and what Carmen had to do to get to that point. She is feisty and until she met Kurt, she saved herself in several ways.

B00H07FW5E,A331IHH6S1V861,"03 25, 2014",M. Almaguer-Marino,Most Truly by Reina M. Williams,"I do not consider myself to be a Jane Austen purist but perhaps I am. Jane Austen is my favorite author and I re-read her works every day&#8212;a chapter before I turn out the lights every night&#8212; as well as critical analyses and scholarly studies on her work. I have no desire to read spinoffs of her novels, but I can certainly appreciate and understand how she continues to influence, inspire, and entertain over 200 years after her death; in fact, she&#8217;s the reason I read historical romance.Pride and Prejudice is arguably Jane Austen&#8217;s most popular and famous novel and many fans cite it as their favorite. People are fascinated, charmed, and entertained by the story of the taciturn Mr. Darcy falling head over heels for the impetuous and lively Elizabeth Bennet who stands up to his imperious behavior.In Most Truly, Reina M. Williams tells us she was inspired to write this unplanned novella of Kitty Bennet&#8217;s story after re-reading Pride and Prejudice in the 200th anniversary year of its publication, which was in 2013.The story takes place at Pemberley, where Kitty often visits her sister, Elizabeth, and Elizabeth&#8217;s husband, Darcy. Here she feels free and calm, away from her overbearing and hypochondriac mother and silent father, free to indulge in quiet reflection while at the same time, meet people and expand her social horizons.I find a very quiet Kitty here but, then again, she was quiet in comparison to her sister, Lydia, and her antics; she was a follower. Here, Kitty is free to make her own choices and govern her own behavior as well to discern what she wants from life. At the beginning of this novella, she simply wants to enjoy time with her sister and her new husband on the lovely grounds of Pemberley. She also befriends Darcy&#8217;s sweet sister, Georgiana, who plays matchmaker here.Yet Kitty is haunted by her own past behavior and the questionable reputation that she and Lydia cultivated with their reckless actions that culminated in Lydia&#8217;s scandalous elopement. Kitty sees this time as an opportunity to reinvent herself; she is determined not to lose her mind over an officer and disappoint her family again, despite her growing attraction to Colonel Fitzwilliam. &#8220;Certainly she wished to marry someday, but she would improve herself first, be a woman worthy of a good husband.&#8221; (p27)Colonel James Fitzwilliam, Darcy&#8217;s charming cousin and Elizabeth&#8217;s brief love interest, has returned from war with aches and pains as well as weakened eyesight. He vaguely remembers hearing about Lydia and Kitty (much to Kitty&#8217;s mortification) but the Kitty he encounters is quietly lovely, sweet, and very pretty. He is attracted to her, and her demeanor, conversation, and smiles calm his restless soul. It is his duty to marry now but he wishes to marry for love, not merely to satisfy his family&#8217;s wishes. &#8220;He did not like being reminded of the fanciful boy he had been. He had left that boy behind him, to please his father and to survive as a soldier.&#8221; (p20)It seems both Kitty and James are biding their time, awaiting something to  change their lives. &#8220;The vital force of the plants, soon to bloom, the new grass, the trees in bud&#8212;all waiting, as he was, for a new life. Did Kitty feel this anticipation?&#8221; (p22)Of course, popular secondary characters make reappearances. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her nondescript daughter, Anne, are all here. I like that Anne is a much more appealing character here (and with a sweet love interest of her very own). New characters include James&#8217; parents and younger brother, Alfred.There is also a lot of nice description of nature and landscape, of flowers and plants in bloom or about to bloom, birds, and the weather, all quietly complementing the reserved nature of this story.This is a sweet romance, although there is some nicely portrayed sexual tension between Kitty and James&#8212;especially in the drawing room scene. Lizzy, Darcy, and Georgiana all notice their attraction and quietly encourage and endorse it, but it&#8217;s all very proper and discreet. This is a very calm story with restless emotions just under the surface. It is not written in language in the style of Jane Austen&#8212;for that, I highly recommend Second Impressions by Ava Farmer&#8212;but that&#8217;s fine with me as, if it can&#8217;t be done successfully (which is very difficult), it&#8217;s best avoided.Logophile&#8217;s delight: chaffinch, smellfunguses, pipit, vandyked.Memorable moments:&#8220;It was difficult to step the balance of being agreeable and cheerful while not being silly and careless.&#8221;  (p15)&#8220;She wanted to be heard, understood. Perhaps no one had really listened to her before. Or perhaps she had not listened to herself&#8212;he had not when he was a young man.&#8221; (p23)A light and charming novella that impressed this Jane Austen aficionado.",4

In fact, you'll be able to guess what some of the characters are going to do next - especially when Nick and Beth start getting close. But the build-up for each character and the pacing of how the story develops is so, so well-written you'll be drooling for what happens next.If you need comparisons, think Danielle Steele or Jackie Collins. Beth is the ever-strong but slightly vulnerable while Nick appears to hide his flaws, until his past starts catching up with him. So, can love at first sight conquer all or is it the first layer to a nightmare that will reinforce your cynical side to all things 'love'?

B00APOR7U2,A291ZZ61DELVH1,"01 15, 2013","The Rekindled Reader ""Boom.""","SERIES REVIEW: Not much of a mystery, but worthy of a guilty pleasure","Books like those in Terri Reid's Mary O'Reilly Series remind me why I chose to do a 10-star rating scale instead of a 5-star one. On one hand, I enjoyed the overall story and I didn't want to give it a negative review. On the other hand, there were so many little nits I couldn't ignore. I found myself liking the book ""in spite of..."", and I couldn't decide if that was good or bad.Since flat lining in the hospital after being shot in the line of duty, former police officer, Mary O'Reilly, can communicate with the dead. Using her new ability, Mary sets up shop as a private investigator, helping ghosts with unfinished business move on.Each of the books has its own ""mystery (and I'm using that word loosely, as I'll explain), but much of the plot focuses on Mary and her relationship with Bradley, the town's Police Chief. Bradley comes with his own personal ghosts. Eight years ago, his pregnant wife disappeared and he's never been able to find out what happened to her. You can see where this is going.In the beginning, the characters were great. I genuinely liked Mary. She was smart, witty and had just enough naivety to be endearing without being a twit. Bradley was a little one-dimensional, but down to earth and open to possibilities, which made him a great match for Mary. Mary's friends, Rosie and Stanley (who I can't help picture as Fred and Ethel Mertz from I Love Lucy), sashayed in to provide a little comedic relief. The other characters - the suspects and the bad guys - were only present enough to raise suspicions.That's not to say some of the characters weren't corny as hell. Especially the villains. I won't give anything away, but the person who ends up being the villain in the first book actually says, during the dramatic moment where he/she evil explains the evil plan, ""It makes it so much easier to get away,"" he/she takes a dramatic pause, ""...with murder."" I'm not sure if that was meant to be so bad it's funny, but it certainly earned a loud snort from me.My main problems with the series:The series is billed as a paranormal mystery, but there isn't much mystery to it. In the first few books, you can guess who did it pretty much as soon as they're introduced. Instead of working on improving the mystery  aspect of the book, Reid seemed to push it aside and focus more on the relationship between Bradley and Mary.There were too many grammatical errors! I think I'm fairly forgiving of grammar usage in books. I don't hold authors to using the King's English and I can accept maybe one or two typos if it's otherwise fine. But each book had so many errors - things were spelled wrong, words were repeated, characters were introduced and then re-introduced in the next paragraph - that I couldn't ignore it.As the series went on, I started getting this weird religious vibe. Not just religious, but proselytizing. It was like being invited to an ""ice cream social"" that turns out to be a ploy to get people to join a church. I didn't mind Mary's ""old fashioned"" values (like she was waiting until marriage to have sex). In fact, it was kind of refreshing since gratuitous sex scenes are becoming almost cliches in this genre. But, as Bradley and Mary's relationship grew, it seemed like every few minutes they were reminding themselves (and the reader) how they could go no further than kissing.Furthermore, I couldn't help but noticed the only two mentions of relations in the book were in the situation where the character was pregnant, having an affair, or was being raped. I thought that was a little strange.And further furthermore, it seemed like Stanley became really bigoted toward the end. He started controlling Rosie, almost treating her like a subordinate, and repeatedly made comments about someone needing to speak English since they were in this country.Oh and further further furthermore, if I remember correctly, only the bad guys are mentioned drinking alcohol.It just made me suspicious.But, as I said, I really did enjoy most of the story (more so in the first few books). It just had some rough spots and I hope Reid can get back to more of the mystery aspect of the books (though, given the end of #9, I doubt it will). I fully intend to read the next book when it comes out, but it may not be on the top of my to-read list.",4
B00BY5XSIG,A20Z5SSCQ90QQ6,"08 13, 2013","Kim ""Read Your Writes Book Reviews""",Oh my Nate... Still shaking my head.,"Reviewed by Kimfor Read Your Writes Book ReviewsTwo Wrongs, One Right is a hot and steamy second chance romance. It's the third book in the Come Undone Series, but is completely stand alone.Eight years ago, Nathan Schultz and Chelsea Callaghan broke each other's hearts. The secret high school sweethearts thought they had a future together until Nate left to join the Army and Chelsea moved roughly four hours away. Though Nate learned where Chelsea was a month after he returned from basic training, he refused to ""chase after her"". During the entire eight years, neither has spoken to the other, but strangely were able to keep tabs on the other through the art world.Finally, Nate decides enough is enough. His best friend has returned home, met someone, and fell in love. His brother is getting married to the love of his life. Everyone around him is happy and Nate is just existing. He decides he's ready for a chance with Chelsea now and he will do whatever it takes to get her back. Nate pulls a romantic move and invites Chelsea to his brother's weekend wedding. Chelsea accepts, though she's not quite sure why and doesn't really want to be around Nate. Her weekend mission is clear to her, say her peace and sever all ties with Nate.Nate blackmails Chelsea into staying the weekend and spending the time with him in his hotel room. He needs to win her trust back but it's not going to be easy. They connect on a physical level and Nate uses it to his advantage. I wasn't prepared for the light BDSM Nate pulled in the book. But I will say the man knows exactly what he's doing.Over the course of the weekend, both Nate and Chelsea realize that eight years ago they were too preoccupied with their own pain to realize what the other was going through and how their actions contributed to the hurt feelings. Because his father took off when he was young, Nate wanted to prove to Chelsea that he could take care of her and that she didn't have to be held hostage by the life her politically conservative family wanted for her. For Chelsea, she just wanted to be able to make her own choices instead of someone always making them for her.Nate and Chelsea had great banter, among other things. They each tried to get the upper hand not admitting how bad they wanted the other. I was amazed by the transformation and realizations these two made. I was also surprised about how touching the story was. It actually brought tears to my eyes.Source: Publisher",4
B00CX5V74I,A2G2PUX1JP4RZR,"09 28, 2013","Valerie Fink ""StuckInBooks""",4 stars - Two souls that crave and need each other - such a great ride!,"When trust is taken at a young age, it's hard to trust again.  Both of these two characters have trust issues.  Both have come from similar childhoods where moms made decisions that affected them profoundly.  But each has reacted to things differently.  Avery plays the field, never letting a guy in her bed for long and never in her heart.  Bennett holds his heart differently, not giving a girl all of him.  They need each other to learn that trust again.When I was asked to read this one, I read the premise and thought - oh yeah...WANTS.  Tattoo artist and player girl?  Hearts hidden but events changing that?  Yes, please.  I love it when two people can heal each other.  Some may feel it's an over used New Adult theme but I think it's the most hopeful thing about New Adult.  So many grow up in less than perfect circumstances and those years right after reaching adulthood is the time to either fix it or to become more jaded.  I love the hopeful stories of healing hearts and minds.  And the healing in the story doesn't magically happen just because they are attracted to each other - no time and experiences combined with that attraction build the love they need to heal.  Loved that.I so loved Bennett.  He's a hot artist.  Yeah he does tats too but I love that he's an artist first.  He draws and there's an art show in the story.  We see a couple of his consult sessions for tattoos and I love how he asks questions and then he draws from their answers, creating something unique for each person.  My daughter is an artist and I recognize the process.  She starts with someone's idea but then she wants details to make it real.  I love how the art comes alive then.  So Bennett rang true to me.While this boy is a virgin, he is no saint - his words.  He has some sexy experience and it flows through the story A LOT.  Oh yeah, this is steamy and sexy.  Everything and anything is fair game except that one last thing.  And skills?  This boy has some skills.I loved Avery too.  She's protecting herself after some pretty tough pain in her teens.  I so got her and I was proud of her.  She pulled herself out of the mess that was her upbringing.  College and a job are her focus.  Kick-boxing and self-defense are important parts of her life along with a couple of great girlfriends.  She's strong and determined - perhaps a little too determined to protect her heart.  In this one thing, her and Bennett are polar opposites.  She's bound up her battered heart to protect it while he's waiting to find the only one that's going to ever own his.  Loved them together from the first time they meet.The story is strong and I didn't want to put it down.  I really liked the combination of detail and summary.  The balance was perfect.  I never felt like I missed anything but got the whole story.  Started it one night and woke up early the next day to finish it.  The clues gave me what was up with Avery's past and I did figure out most things a little before they happened but I loved it!If the New Adult bug has bitten you like it has me, then you should totally pick this one up!  If that NA bug hasn't bitten, you need to let it and this one is a great one to start. - See more at: [...]",4

B00DH7XAE6,A17H3ZRZKKWQJH,"06 28, 2013",Nikyta,Cute and fun read!,"I really enjoyed this story. It has a sweet and slow pace when it comes to the romance between Dayton and Hart. It was a lot of fun to read with some moments that had me chuckling.I loved Dayton. He might be a puny human but he's a stubborn man that won't be bullied or pushed into anything he doesn't want to be. He's blissfully naive when it comes to being Hart's mate and shocked when he finally finds out. He was just so adorable. His actions were either funny or made me want to go awwww. Hart was completely sexy, IMO. I loved the whole Alpha Male thing and the fact that he was a liger and purred pretty much whenever he was holding Dayton, I adored it.The story revolves around Dayton finding out that he's Hart's mate and, because of Hart's banishment, that puts Dayton into an awkward position. As the only human in the pride, no one is supposed to interact with Hart and that includes Dayton. Now Dayton has to pick between what he considers his family and Hart. It has sweet moments with a dash of suspense but also is a bit different than the traditional shifter story.My only reservations is that there were some things left open-ended or unanswered such as the whole Rick thing but also a lot of the dynamics of the pride. More than that, since the story is sort of short, it sometimes felt too rushed with some scenes that were skipped over. There were scenes I felt were sort of crucial to the story, to get deeper into it (like the whole Rick situation) but were glossed over or skipped entirely. I'd have liked to see them actually played out instead of getting the recap weeks later.Overall, I loved the characters. They had just enough depth to get to know them and like them. The conflict is a little vague but I still liked where it was headed. It could have been a bit longer but it's still a really enjoyable read especially with the secondary characters, they were a lot of fun to read about! While the story has a good enough ending to be complete, I desperately hope there's more to come of Dayton and Hart. It would be awesome to figure out how they're handling things now that everything has smoothed out, more or less.",4

B00AREMKV6,A2W8PK154LUQ8H,"10 10, 2013",No Labels,Relevant Conversation in these Current Times,"This is part of a joint review done on The Review Board: [...]At first, I must admit, it took me a while to get into it. The juices really didn't start flowing for me until about Chapter 8. In some points it seemed a bit drawn out, and in others, some of the action bordered close to the unrealistic-like Monk being a borderline superhero, almost indestructible until close to the end.There were also places where the dialogue was squeezed together (issues with formatting) as well as the political dialogue being slightly excessive. It also would have been nice to have seen some more female characters, especially those that had the same type of strength as Cliffson's wife.Despite it all, I found this to be a great read for many reasons. One is the strong connection between what's happening in the book and current events, such as the state of unemployment, the national debt, and cutting spending on federal programs. There were also characters in the novel that paralleled the general public.Overall, Truth's Blood is deeper than a novel. It is a write that warrants conversation across different generations and different subcultures and deserving of a read. Great read for political enthusiasts and conspiracy theory buffs.",4

Nick can't stand being second choice in Eric's life anymore and decides to move on. Although feeling hurt and rejected by Nick's decision, Eric appears to be comfortable in the place his life is at the moment. All that seems to be missing is having someone to share it with - someone to support him and care for him. With Nick gone and Ally back in his life, he finds in her a perfect candidate for a life partner. Smart and beautiful with a sense of humor that lightens Eric's mood, Ally is reluctant to take the role of Eric's wife. She wants the marriage to Eric be real with caring from both parties and with no unfaithfulness. Eric agrees to her terms and their life as a couple begins only to have Nick put it in jeopardy.I have to say that I am not a fan of Ally. Never was, never will. But in this installment I had the chance to see a different side to her that made her feel real to me which in the end helped me connect to her a bit more than before. She is assertive and knows what she wants, which I have always liked in a main character. She stood up to Eric but at the same time showed her caring side each step of the way.In this installment we see a different side of Eric too. No longer haunted by his past to the extent of causing harm to himself, Eric has grown from the troubled young man we met in book one into a caring, thoughtful man who is looking into the future with a new perspective in life - to be happy. His thoughts are positive and his perception of himself has improved, but underneath it all he still loves Nick and finds it hard to let go of what they shared. He is determined to make this marriage work but even though he opens up to Ally he never does it in the way he did with Nick.The writing was everything I have come to expect from Cat Grant. With great insight into the characters, fun and engaging dialog and sexual chemistry abound, she brought to the page the growth each character has made and how their life's experiences have shaped them after their college years. I appreciated the doubts and motives that came forward in regards to the marriage between Eric and Ally. I think it put into perspective how much Eric believed he was ready to move on and Ally's ambition.This is a cast of characters I love to hate. One moment I'm cheering and supporting them then I'm cursing the hell out of them. This novella brought to a lot of those feelings in me again. I didn't want them to get together, then I saw how good they were for each other so I accepted it only to have to question my feelings again when Nick returned. Well played Cat Grant, well played.  I am truly hooked and invested in these characters. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series to see how this all works out for these characters.",4

She likes her job, loves her friends, and hopes she never has to see her ex-husband, Josh, again now that she lives far from his Arkansas home. She loves New Orleans, even if she is a bit of a rarity there: a submissive coyote shifter in a town filled with dominant wolves. Most of them, she just ignores, but one man keeps her on her toes. Julio Mendoza is the hottest thing she has ever seen, and she wouldn't mind getting to know him better.When her obsessive ex shows up in New Orleans, Julio convinces Sera to take a bit of a vacation, and he decides to combine business with a bit of pleasure and join her. Once they are out of town, both are able to relax and enjoy each other's company. Harmless flirting becomes something more, and the attraction between them grows. Julio has pack business to attend to, and Sera worries that trouble could arise from her being along, since most wolves see her as less than worthy. But there is trouble around every corner, and Sera proves to Julio and to the others that being submissive doesn't mean she can't take care of herself. And Julio discovers that dominant doesn't have to be bad with the right partner. Can these two learn to accept the growing feelings between them? When danger threatens, can Julio get to Sera in time to stop Josh and protect what he has come to realize is his mate? Will the wolves accept Sera as a wolf's woman, or will trouble erupt?Impulse is the fifth book in Moira Rogers' Southern Arcana series, and is my favorite to date. This one takes the characters out of the familiar locale of New Orleans, and on a road trip across the south. I like the interaction between Sera and Julio, at times light and teasing, two people getting better acquainted while enjoying the trip. I liked watching as they began to sense that each of them wanted more than a light flirtation. I love the Southern Arcana world, and enjoyed this expansion of it to other areas.Sera Sinclaire is strong, determined and ready to fight for the life she wants. She knows the wolves see her as weak; at times even she thinks she is. But with Julio, she learns that being submissive isn't necessarily a bad thing, that it doesn't make her a pushover. I like Sera's inner strength, and her ability to make friends and soothe hurt feelings.Julio Mendoza is strong, in both his magic and in sheer physical strength. He's handsome, sexy and protective of those he cares for. With Sera, he learns that he can let go for a while and just let her be in charge when it's the one thing she needs. I liked seeing him let her have her victories, and listening to her ideas without vetoing them out of hand. I enjoyed watching as he fell for her and discovered she wanted the same things he did.This wouldn't be a Moira Rogers book without the steamy and passionate romance, and there are a couple of absolutely toe curling scenes in this one. There is also non-stop action, danger, treachery and a bit of family betrayal to be dealt with. There are lots of new characters along the road trip, and some I would enjoy meeting again in the future. I enjoyed seeing how Sera and Julio were able to bring attention to the problems in the area outside of New Orleans, and it was fun seeing some of the characters from past books step up to help as well.Do these two beat the odds for a happy ever after? I'm not saying, but I will warn you to stay by the air conditioner, this one is a scorcher.originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews",4

When you talk about something happening to you and another person you generally use me not I, for example, Stan opened the door for Jeremy and me.  If you are unsure remove the other person's name and listen to how it sounds.  Emma, you wouldn't say Stan opened the door for I...you would say Stan opened the door for me.I really like the writing but the grammar and editing need work.I would still recommend the series as it is a lovely story of a young girl who has been broken by life and the gentle young billionaire who rescues her twice.",4

A veteran's PTSD complicates his life and his service dog allows him to lead a normal life including interactions with others and holding down a job. There was romance, laughter and some tears and all in just a quickie read of 65 pages.There was an actual storyline with nice closure, good character development and my interest was immediately engaged on page one. While I would have liked to see a little more of Jordan's and Alaina's interactions and potential relationship, both ups and downs, I was satisfied by the conclusion but wouldn't mind a sequel to get to know both of them better.I enjoyed this story and look forward to reading others by West.Favorite Quote: Alaina accepted the phone and burst into laughter. Jordan had taken a picture of Abe and put the dog's head on a racially ambiguous surfer body. ""I should get you to test all of my apps.

It was very vivid, creative and for a short it was written very complete. There are no questions as to the why or how. It's all in there within the 40 pages that are written. That takes a great amount of skill in my eyes.Ellie is taken by complete surprise when trying for a job as a dancer. Thinking she just has to show what she's made of then BAM! Her life is changed completely and forever. She's strong, alone and does not feel emotions, but ends up finding out how and why in the long run. Basically being held captive to the master vampire that has turned her, she finds a friend of sorts. Someone she feels she can trust and trust is not something Ellie does.Ian is doing his part as the master vampire's servant. Little does anyone know that he's really there to get information on the horde of vampires that live there so that they can be stopped from destroying human lives any longer. He meets Ellie the night she's trying for a job and witnesses her attack by the master vampire Liam and is unable to do anything because of the importance of his position. He's determined to keep Ellie on the side of good and have her as his, forever.Ellie and Ian are an extremely sweet couple that I was glad to see matched. They each have a spark of hope due to the others presence and they go through a couple of very scary situations but always have one another's back.Anyone looking for a short and quick vampire read will enjoy this original work by Danica Winters :)",4

Mann ""&#34;Study History - Know the Future...",Some holes but mainly very enjoyable read,"I admit that as a career US Army person and one very familiar with the history of World War 2 in the Pacific and the China-Burma-India Theater, I could be very critical of part of the book.  However, remember that almost everyone reading this will not know that an SBD and it's US Army Air Force sister the A-24) was armed with two .50 caliber machine guns firing forward and two .30 caliber machine guns mounted in a 180- degree slide mount in the rear cockpit.  Also, that at the time of this book, the slower, less powerful engine'd SBD-2 would have been the airplane flown (They were &#34;new&#34; in 1940-1941).  Also, the little problem of mis-naming a Browning Automatic Rifle ('The BAR&#34;) as something else, I think.  No matter except to hyper-critical military readers as I am.  The interplay between the soldiers on the island was just about what I would have expected in that situation.  The guys probably didn't even have the &#34;new steel helmets&#34; to wear but were perching the old World War I &#34;Dishpans&#34; on their heads.  I think Richard has a very interesting and promising series building up here.  People who are displaced in Time are always a fascinating story.  Remember reading &#34;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&#34; when we were in the 4th and 5th grades?  (Well, not today they don't, of course, considering that literacy is no longer important in USA Public Schools)  However, Young people, particularly, will enjoy this book especially if they &#34;follow up&#34; by getting their computers out and looking up &#34;SBD&#34;, Navy Nurse Corps, Army Air Force, Pacific War, etc. and so forth on their Wikipedia.

B005ET2050,APZHV01P5FVF3,"07 6, 2013",Beeshon,Excellent novel by Tim Vicary,"I thoroughly enjoyed this historic-fiction novel by Tim Vicary, my first experience of this author. Set in a politically divided Ireland in the early nineteen hundreds and backdropped by the First World War, it stages politics, class, and romance and demonstrates how the three just don't mix.Catherine is a single-minded, obstinate, and determined young girl, the daughter of a wealthy colonel. Sean is  a fanatical young man, dedicated to the IRA and its elusive leader, Michael Collins. Their attraction to each other is fated: they are separated by class, and Catherine has to balance her tenuous loyalty to her father with her love for Sean, who is being sought by the police for murder and hopefully to lead them to Michael Collins. Exasperated and under pressure to find both men, the British government is brought in, and Catherine's colonel father enlists the stern and lonely Andrew Butler, a hero of the war, to find and assassinate Michael Collins. But the path to the success of this is hampered: how is that their fugitive is always one step ahead of his pursuer?This was a compelling story. One occasionally forgot the era in which the story was set: there was a modernness about some of the characters that perhaps was a little incongruous, but actually, this was what I really liked. The author didn't overpower and bog it down with excessive historic detail. In fact, his words were carefully chosen throughout to keep you focussed and glued to the plot. There was no redundancy of words, nor lack thereof. The book was tense, very well conceived, and gripping and kept you on edge to the end. I loved the contrast provided by Catherine and Sean, both committed to their own ambitions, separated by their backgrounds, but bound by their passion.I very much liked this author's style and his story-telling ability and will certainly look forward to reading more by him. I thoroughly recommend this.",4

The story moves at a very quick pace and unless the reader infers the bond between both characters it becomes unbelievable.  Yes two characters who live together and act as a couple will gain a certain closeness but I felt that element wasn't captured in this story.  One moment Karen is paying Madeline to act as a girlfriend the next Madeline is willingly kissing Karen and having feelings- the in-between having been glossed over.However, I couldn't get enough of Madeline's feisty attitude and wit.  There is a certain scene where Karen is flirting with &#34;some skank&#34; and Madeline lets her know if she flirts in front of her again she will give her salmonella.

I never read Pride & Prejudice, nor have I ever watched the movie versions....I know! I am a freak of nature and not fit to be considered an avid reader. Having said that, I feel a little guilty reviewing this modern take on the classic Jane Austin novel. I am going to give it a shot though.This story is told from Spring's point of view. We get to ride along with her as she deals with friends, family and love. She is young and in the process of finding herself. She has a chip on her shoulder and something to prove. But underneath the tough hippie chick, is a sensitive soul. Henry sees this and that is what makes this story so sweet. Henry stays by her side when she is being absolutely ridiculous.Henry is not perfect though. He has his share of bombshells. There are miscommunications and secrets that cause quite a bit of drama. Spring is not an overly emotional woman but she finds herself unable to deny the intensity of her emotions when it comes to Henry.I adored Henry's argyle wearing, straight laced, lawyer persona. I loved it because through it all, he was able to recognize something in Spring that was missing from himself. She made him better. And in the end he made her better as well. They both came together to complete one another. Yes, it's sappy, but it worked.The only thing I found distracting were all of the secondary characters and side stories. It felt like too much at times. I also really wish we had some of Henry's point of view, I wanted to know what was going on in that infuriating man's head! Having said that, I still give this a rock solid four stars. I would definitely recommend this book to fans of the New Adult genre as well as fans of Contemporary Romance.",4

B00AMTDRU4,A1EFAN0M6235BY,"03 18, 2013","Peggy A. Morin ""The Self-Help Guru""",dream weaving meets philosophy in the cosmic stream,"This book is reminiscent of The Never Ending Story and in fact, seems to have a similar objective.  It begins with a grandfather speaking to a grandchild about the meaning of life, especially in relation to the spirit of finding one's soul mate and how `time' is merely a mechanism of the ebb and flow of the soul's dance.  These are timeless questions being addressed and they remain ever meaningful to all.  Personally, I think this book is especially good for sharing between the young and their elders, and even, vice versa. The similarity that I speak of between Quexistence and The Never Ending Story is its use of a fantastical universe as a doorway to understanding the great philosophical questions of life including the vastness of possibilities, the ripple effects of what we are drawn to and choose for ourselves, and how all things are truly connected in the cosmic flow.  An interesting paradigm and a fun approach to philosophy, I recommend it for all, young and old alike. Enjoy!",4

After two weeks there, she discovers that six months have passed in the real world and many things have changed since she left.First and foremost, she learns that Xander is barely controlling his kingdom. In an effort to fix that, he wants Darian as his queen. However, as you know if you&#8217;ve followed the series so far, Darian and Xander share a special relationship that isn&#8217;t necessarily sexual. While Xander tries to convince her of that anyways, I don&#8217;t really think either one of them want it. Xander sees Darian as a powerful tool, something to possess and he is a man who will do anything in order to obtain that power. On the other end, the last thing Darian needs is someone trying to use her abilities and brain in a way to benefit themselves.Things with Tyler remain strained. After deciding that he doesn&#8217;t want to stand around and watch as Darian puts herself in danger time and time again, Tyler walks away and that causes immense heartbreak for Darian. However, I have to admire the way Bonilla pours emotions into her characters. They make mistakes and they can be selfish and blind at times as well, but that only makes them more appealing in my eyes. It&#8217;s interesting to watch how they will come out in top.Raif is the standout character for me. Every time he was in a scene, it just made me smile. I like what he is for Darian and what he does for the series as whole.While the ending does leave room for more unanswered questions, Bonilla creates a fun-filled rollercoaster ride for readers to enjoy.*ARC provided by author",4
B004YDU4PA,A2CNSKV0M20WT,"07 24, 2012",V. Cano,Loved it,"Short story collections are always tricky to read, and therefore to review, since many times the reader doesn't get a feeling for the author's writing. This one, however, surprised me.The writing is effortless. Even one of the stories, ""Choose Your Future"", which is written in second person, flows really well. Anyone who's ever tried writing in that tense can understand why this is such a feat. But it's not just this story. They all have different styles; none of them sound quite the same as the ones before, which is fantastic, and refreshing.One of the more interesting stories is ""The Waster's Tale."" It is written so that we know the main character has a strong accent, so it can be a little challenging to read, but the story itself is so great, once you get started you can't put it down. Another good one is ""Work Abroad"", about young women who are promised jobs in Europe, only to be sold into slavery. Tough to read, but well written.This is definitely a good collection for all lovers of short stories and I do recommend it.",4

Maria has panic attacks as she hands in completed test papers because the teacher's assistant looks at her.  Owen tries to hide himself from the world, but his roommate pushes him out to fun public venues, where Maria is also pushed to visit with her very best friend, Tina.  With Maria never talking about being molested and threatened in the past, and Owen never talks about the deadly abuse he continues to suffer at the hands of his father, the two tentatively find a bond that is tested through events that neither foresees, events that allows them to venture out a bit more than they could do alone.  The real challenge, though is for each of them to face their fears, to find the courage to live life the way &#34;normal&#34; people seem to do.This is a good story for young people wanting to know more about the effects of abuse on young people, to learn how the experiences tend to isolate and hurt people far beyond the actual acts.  It depicts the strength found in true friends, and it gives a silent message that sometimes families are formed with people we meet rather than the people we live with in our childhood.An excellent story for young readers who want to know more about how the world works, it is less than exciting for older adults, who have most likely learned not only the lessons the book relates, but who know that there is so much more to life stories than this tale would tell.  It is a story that lacks some of the depth of description that would provide a rich storytelling style, but even the superficial descriptions get the job done. While there is good plot development, the style is that of a writer that will be stupendous with just a bit more effort and experience that could likely bring out the depths that are hinted at in, for instance, Tina's character.This book will encourage the reader to finish this story and seek more works by Nadia Simonenko, and this book clearly reflects the author's clear understanding of the devastation that abuse can reek on innocent victims, both female and male.",4

I was not compensated nor was I required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.What I love about these authors is that they are good at not confusing their readers - they could switch back and forth between the two time periods but we get the historical (Elizabeth's story) first. Our authors remind the reader that in that long ago time period duty was everything. Feelings really didn't have that much to do with anything - makes you wonder if in some cultures this is still true today.There's still the good versus evil going on in the background. But you're left wondering, until almost the very end, which will come out on top. And by combining the background of Cordelia's ancestor with her current life is what makes this a page-turner. By adding in notations from a journal that Cordelia reads to us, it's like Elizabeth is talking to us. This is a way that the authors engage the reader and leaves them wondering how this will affect the future and more specifically how this will affect Cordelia.Even though the reader may be anxious to find out how everything works out, our authors don't rush anything. To rush the story along would have spoiled things. If you're patient you will get your sex scenes but not until the perfect time and it will be worth the wait. This is a must to have on your e-reader.",4

The plot is a bit unusual, in that it encompasses traits of a love at first sight romance, as well as traits of a second chance at love, while really being neither.  Furthermore, despite its fairly short length, the author manages to create a fully developed story, with well drawn characters.Bron and Honey have their first encounter at the ages of 24 and 18, respectively, in a crowded London ballroom.  Although Bron spends the better part of that evening observing Honey, the two do not interact, other than one intense moment where their gazes meet.  Unfortunatley, Bron allows his head to rule his heart, and thus makes no attempt to meet the intriguing beauty.  Just two short weeks later, Bron, still enthralled with the memory of Honey, discovers that any chance he might have had with the beauty is forever lost; Honey had been forced into marriage with a man some 40 years her senior.For the next twelve years Bron lives his life to the fullest, forever haunted by Honey's beautiful visage.  On a subconscious level, he compares every woman he meets with his memory of Honey. In the meantime, Honey endures years of marriage to her mean spirited husband who, after nine years, finally, and blessedly, dies.Bron, fleeing his latest scandal in London, finds himself secluded at his friends estate in the wilds of Yorkshire.  This is where Bron and Honey finally become acquainted, and Bron gets his second chance at love; although, initially the dolt does not recognize it as such.At first, Bron is merely determined to get Honey into his bed, but the shy beauty is a skittish as a newborn colt and leads him on a merry chase.  Finally, Bron realizes that not only is he in love with Honey, but on some level he has always been in love with her.  By this time, he has reason to be concerned that he has ruined his second chance at love with Honey (see what I mean by this being a LAFS/SCAL plot, yet not really?)The story is a really sweet one.  Although, I have to say that at first I wasn't very enamored with Bron...I found his determination to bed Honey a bit off-putting.  However, as the story progressed I began to like him more and more, and by the end of the book, I loved him as much, if not more, than Honey.  LOL  I thought this was a wonderful story.Personally, I would have liked the period of time that elapsed between the first encounter and subsequent meetng to be less than twelve years, but that's just a personal preference.  I really don't think the lesser time would have made that much difference to the story, if any difference at all.The book, however, did touch on one of my pet peeves...titles and proper forms of address.  I really hate it when authors get the titles and forms of address for the aristocracy incorrect.  Especially since as such errors do not need to occur.  It's really a simple matter to google the topic and voila!...the problem is solved.  In this instance, Bron's full name is Bron Alvarice, Viscount Blackthorne.  Throughout the story he is constantly referred to as Lord Alvarice, which is NOT correct.  His proper form of address should be Lord Blackthorne.  Moreover, in the first chapter, the events of which occur before Bron inherits his title, his proper form of address, as the eldest son of a Viscount, is The Honorable Bron Alvarice, again NOT Lord.  Furthermore, his friend Sir Gordon Tern is referred to as a baron, when really he's a baronet.Other than the blatant error with the titles, this book is just about perfect and thus, garners 4 1/2 stars from this reader.  I loved it and highly recommend it.  BTW this is a clean romance...there is a love scene, but no details.  Happy reading!",4

I loved how all the characters interacted with each other. And to be honest I forget some characters names that aren&#8217;t the main ones but these you cannot forget.

B007RLGGSU,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,"07 7, 2013",Roger J. Buffington,"An interesting ""alien invasion"" scenario","Author Nuttall proves in this novel that one can write about and conclude satisfactorily an alien invasion scenario in one novel rather than a series such as Nuttall's own ""Outside Context Problem"" series.  In this novel Nuttall presents a story in which the aliens are only modestly advanced over human technology but harbor designs upon our planet similar to those in ""Outside Context Problem.""  More would be telling, but this is a readable and interesting novel that I enjoyed reading.Mostly Nuttall manages to make this novel plausible, but some of the alien technology seemed implausible to me.  For example, the aliens employed air-cushioned tanks rather than tracked vehicles.  Sorry, but this technology is well understood and I find it highly doubtful that aliens would have found a breakthrough employing this approach that allowed their tanks to vastly outperform the M1 Abrams.  Similarly, the alien infantry is blessed with invulnerable light body armor.  Once again, humans have been looking at this technology for a long time and one wonders whether there really is a ""magic bullet"" in this direction.  Well, maybe.  These are minor quibbles that in no way detracted from the enjoyment of the novel, and this one scores a solid triple.  This one is recommended for those who enjoy the ""military science fiction"" genre.  RJB.",4

Goodrich ""asgoodrich""",4 stars = I REALLY liked this book,"What happens when a girl who has been convinced by her entire community (family included) that she's worthless meets a boy who has convinced himself that he doesn't deserve forgiveness or happiness? You get the story of Lacey and Everett, two people who have been broken but who have a chance to mend one another as their friendship develops over a summer. Everett is a rich-kid from New York who is house-sitting for the summer. Lacey is a poor girl working two jobs and living in a trailer park with her brother, mother, and grandmother. They are two people who should have never met, but thanks to her so-called friend and soon-to-be ex-boyfriend they meet on one of the worst nights in Lacey's life and thus begin their journey.I liked how the two filled a need in one another's life and became close before their relationship became sexual (great sex scenes by the way). I have no issue with books in which the two main characters &#34;hook up&#34; right off the bat, but the delay was especially important in this book considering the relationship that Lacey was getting out of and her desire to change the path on which her life seemed to be headed. Fortunately Everett's issues kept him from moving their relationship forward before she was ready. We learn that both have very good reasons for being cautious, but despite this there is very little back and forth angst (i.e., will he, won't he) that is so common in the New Adult genre. This does not mean that there isn't conflict and turmoil, but I never felt the need to slap some sense into either of them while reading the book.Sarah Fawkes has written a tragically beautiful love story that I enjoyed immensely.

London in the 1800's is full of polite society. Act this way, be this way, dress this way. Anything that meet with the standards of polite society are shunned, made fun of, gossiped about, in general, thought to be less than everyone else.Evangeline suffers from that problem. She's part Roma, or gypsy. As a result those in polite society gossip about her and call her loose. Even though she's followed all the rules, the men continue to say she loose and the women are just harridans! It's awful!Ian has come to London to avenge the death of his brother and father. He's been told by his step-mother and sister that Evangeline is responsible for their deaths AND she stole away his sister's beau. Due to his honor, he ends up married to Evangeline and risking everything to protect her.In many ways Ian was lovable. While I did love him, I also wanted to smack him on the head! He needed a serious wake-up call. He did get that wake-up call unfortunately it came a bit too late. Part of his lovability was his honor. He wanted to believe in the goodness of others. Part of the reason I wanted to smack him upside the head was his ability to believe in the good of others. That ability to believe in the goodness of others cost both Ian and Evangeline.Evangeline was an interesting character. Her Roma heritage managed to give her a positive outlook when most of us would have only expected the worst. It also gave her the ability to look at what was going on around her and listen with her heart. Unfortunately it also cost her dearly.Many lessons can be learned from the characters in this book. Look for the good in others. Watch the actions of others to learn their true intent. Forgive each other. Love with your whole heart.I really enjoyed this story.

B00II124WK,A16Q3WF4M3DJFL,"03 12, 2014","Wag The Fox ""Genre mutt.""",Turns out there are things scarier than yodellers on mountain tops,"I've never really understood the appeal of mountain climbing. It's a mountain. It's steep. I get it. Maybe if there was something up there I wanted I might be enticed into trudging my butt up some snow-capped peak, but all the cool stuff is down here among civilization. Climbing a mountain is like hitting a high score on that old Galaga game at the arcade: sure, you did it, but the only people who care are the others playing the game.Take the poor saps in Dead Five's Pass for instance. A young couple are the first to run afoul of some strange menace near the top of the mountain. It's the kind of terrible fate that seems more fitting for Wall Street executives, not thrill-seeking coeds looking for some neat little geographical anomaly. And that anomaly is attracting quite a few climbers and they're all in trouble if two skilled, albeit psychologically wrecked, rescue workers can't get up there to save them.Carise and Marcel used to be a dream team in the rescuing department, but that was before Carise suffered a miscarriage, deep depression, alcoholism, and terrible guilt over a stranded boy's death. Now they hardly speak, haven't teamed in years, and Marcel's new lady love, Janis, is incensed with the idea they must team up again to save the young men who have traversed the mountain pass in search of the new cave found via satellite photos. The story of Carise and Marcel might feel a little soap opera at first glance, but it doesn't take long for Barnes to squeeze the humanity out of their circumstances. And this story needed a healthy dose of humanity, because what's up in that mountain is the furthest thing from human.The style of horror feels akin to The Thing and Phantoms and some of those other horror stories involving terrible monstrosities lurking just beneath the surface of civility. In this instance, the Lovecraftian vibe is clear. Heck, I was surprised there wasn't a direct reference to it. With as many tentacles and mind-warping visages lurking in the shadows, it's a wonder Barnes managed to dodge the obvious. By the end, it doesn't feel like a Lovecraft story, but a Barnes story. And lemme tell ya, that's not too shabby.I could have used a little more polish on the Marcel/Janis relationship, as it felt a bit perfunctory and left in the lurch once the rescue efforts started getting extra gruesome. Aside from that though, Colin F. Barnes offers one bone-chilling climb up a mountain of madness.",4

The dialogue is quick and witty. The sex scenes were HOT. The characters were likeable.  It was a worthy read and I liked it! What I didn&#8217;t like was the fact that issues that were too painful to talk about, issues that were made to seem like this HUGE secret, were kind of glossed over. This book is not heavy on the emotions. Some heavy issues are a factor in the story but the emotions that Lane and Kat&#8217;s histories should invoke were sort of skipped and made trivial in the scheme of things. It&#8217;s not a bad thing. I think this was meant to be an positive love story and it was. But the issues were tackled too easily for me. I find it hard to believe that something you are running from and have dealt with for years wouldn&#8217;t have had a more lasting effect on the characters.

You will love, laugh, and swoon. You will cry.&#34;...because I'm even more determined to bring that light back to his eyes. And I know my love is strong enough to do it.&#34;The story leaves off right where the last one left off. Eric gave Ivy a harsh ultimatum. One that she did not take lightly. She ends up where she and Eric least expected. But this time apart shows Eric and Ivy that being without each other is just not an option. You feel their yearning for each other. I felt like this was the most heartfelt part of this story. There is no question that Eric and Ivy belong together. Their time apart proves this. This final installment solidifies how much Eric and Ivy are truly meant for each other. Their love knows no boundaries. They love with a love so deeply.&#34;You are my heart now. Whatever happens to you happens to me.&#34;Eric Young. You have totally captured my heart.  He is real. He is genuine. And I can completely see why Ivy so easily fell for him. While Eric is by no means perfect, he is perfect for me-I mean Ivy. :) His past alone would give him reason alone to never give his love to another woman again. And his heartache doesn't end. So many secrets and lies are revealed and your heart breaks for Eric. But what does he do? He loved harder. He loves more. He completely surrenders his heart and soul to Ivy. And it's the most beautiful thing.&#34;I'd rather have weeks, days, hours with you happy and content than a lifetime filled with regret.&#34;If you think you have any idea what is going to happen in this story. You have NO idea. There are so many twists and turns in this story I did not see coming. Hence the reason why you will be reading this in one sitting. Clear your schedule. It's just not possible to put this one down.&#34;When she loves, she loves with her whole heart, giving herself completely, holding nothing back.&#34;I felt that the writing was a lot stronger in Hold Me Tight. Not that the other two in the series weren't strong, I just felt like the voices were stronger in this one. The characters spoke with more conviction. What I really enjoy about this series as a whole that Faith's characters are real. And with the third installment of this story, her strength  in character development shows. Every single character is connected to the story. You feel for them as much as you feel for Eric and Ivy.&#34;But this woman makes me want to do things I didn't think I was capable of. Her love for me makes me feel like I have no limitations, that I can do anything I set my mind to do because she believes in me with her whole heart.&#34;As Eric so eloquently describes, his love never wavers for Ivy. It never falters. Their love is the epitome of all consuming soul searching love. Even through pain, and sorrow, Eric's heart always reached out for Ivy. His soul craved hers. Love always prevails. What a beautiful conclusion to this story.",4

When she flies home for the funeral it's something she's dreading not because her sister's dead but because she has to face the family and friends that killed her. Four years ago she walked out on her sister when she wouldn't do an intervention for her alcohol problem. To Frankie that's the day her sister died. All she wants is to get in and get out what she doesn't expect to find is Topher. Topher was her sister's best friend before he joined the military. Topher is dealing with his own haunted past and trying to live with himself and his injuries. He can't remember what it was like all those years before the military. His short term memory is scrambled but he's determined to move on. When Topher and Frankie cross paths they don't expect the understanding and comfort they find in each other. Their relationship starts off with forgetting and pain but can blossom into something more if they can find a way to open up to each other and let go of what haunts them.This was a beautiful story of pain and sorrow. Two different people with haunted pasts help each other move on and become better. I enjoyed the story. The characters were real and emotional. Frankie was a strong independent woman trying to hold her life together but on the inside she was a fragile lost girl. Topher is a tough military man who is struggling to find who he is and who he was. Both characters experience a profound loss that brings them together. It was a nice story but it lacked the wow factor for me. I was hoping for more depth on their relationship and love. I was hoping for more action but it was purely a romantic story.,4

I needed to know everything like the nosey girl that I am, and each couple was truly amazing to read about and watch their love blossom into: 1. Crazy intense heat that left you wanting. 2. Romantic and happy and in love with boundaries. 3. Intense hate-love that you just do not know what to do with. Which couple does each definition describe? LOL.

I loved that we were able to see a female lead in a power of authority. I don&#8217;t read many that are like this and was truly happy to read the other side for a change. She&#8217;s unhappy with her life and is just going through the motions of what her people and parents want from her. Going out with her BFF one night just changes everything for her, and a love she didn&#8217;t think was possible opens her eyes to passion, sex, and a secret no one warned her about&#8230;Vaughn&#8230;how to describe this lickable male? Hell I dunno, sexy doesn&#8217;t seem to do him justice, but alas it shall preface..sigh.. So we have this man who gets laid on the regular, never finding that spark that&#8217;s kept him wanting the same body twice, but when he meets Naya everything changes. A one-night stand was just what it was, until feelings change and the thought of letting her go doesn&#8217;t seem right anymore. Fighting his (animalistic&#8230;wink**) reactions he tries to do what is best, but when something happens that changes both Vaughn and Naya&#8217;s lives, he cannot stand by anymore.There are secrets and miscommunications throughout this book, buit when everything comes together it made every mistake worth it.

We are thrown in to the mystery club that is Eden. Underground, exclusive, and trying to make a name for itself, with Piper's description of Eden, you can't help but want to be transported there right away. It will make you curious, it will intrigue you, but you will indeed feel like you are right there beside these wonderful, complex characters.I liked Diesel right away. She is a tough chick. She is a bad ass, and she takes no s*** from no one. She has built walls around her heart, and to the outside, these walls look unbreakable. On the inside she is just scared; Scared to love again; Scared to give someone her heart only for them to leave it high and dry. She runs Eden, it's her baby, and she doesn't take well to strangers being in her territory...Enter gorgeous, sexy blogger, Elliot Archer. Tasked to find out more about Eden, Elliot is thrust in to the sexy scene. Upon meeting Diesel he immediately wants to know more about her. Despite advances from other women, he only has his sights set on the beautiful, stubborn, sexy Diesel.&#10077;It's only her. Her breath on me. The brush of her bra on my bare chest. Her smell. The feel of her hair tickling my skin. The warmth of her body. I am lost in her.&#10078;There is this delicious back and forth between these two that will just make you smile. There is also some hot sexual tension that will have you turning up the air conditioning. The build up of the relationship was sweet. The sex wasn't just thrown in there, just because. It was beautiful, charming, and at times heartbreaking.After a horrible event that would leave anyone shaken to the core, you get to witness how strong Diesel really is. After all that she has been through Elliot is there for her, constantly reassuring her, and giving her control when she needs it, and taking it from her when it's what's best. Pretty much just helping her to become whole again.&#10077;I love the feel of his skin on mine, the sound of my name rolling of his tongue.&#10078;Even through the ups and downs, rises and falls, beautiful and ugly moments, their love for each other broke through, and in the end helped them to both to heal and their relationship to grow even stronger. A love story like this is what helps me to believe in true love overcoming all odds. Very well done. Piper Malone is another romance author to look out for.&#10077;I look down at him. He examines me before each kiss, kisses me before each touch, and touches me as if I'm the only woman who exists. In this moment, I think I love this man.&#10078;*Gifted Copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*",4

One of my reading challenges this year was to read a children&#8217;s book because it is good to be reminded of your childhood from time to time. This one was just perfect!The book is simply perfect for young children. When you are just starting out with reading, this is just something that you should have. Reading a good book always helps to cultivate your imagination and the earlier you begin with the process, the better it is.This book has it all. The right amount of stuff happening, curious lovable characters and a sense of excitement. What I thought was that this book needed to be a little more crisp because there were times when I lost track of what happened. The writing also kept fluctuating in terms of keeping my excitement up. Maybe it was the continuous stream of events that kept up or maybe that the Dreaded One didn&#8217;t make quite an impression on my mind. I would have certainly loved a crisper story.But having said that, the end was brilliant. I didn&#8217;t expect the writer to leave it the way he did and I wanted an epilogue!!However, that being said, this book did remind me of reading Enid Blyton when I was small. Those Wishing Chair stories or the Faraway Tree stories did really make my childhood a nicer place. And this book was a reminder of the good old days!!I enjoyed reading this book while I did. I do wish children read more books that stimulate their minds not just the glut of books on romances and sex. I never remember reading that, it was all very clean when I was young, and I would love children to grow in their imaginative cocoons via good books!Note: I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review",4

There is a very different tone between these two books and now Adam and Mia are learning to deal with being in a relationship with each other.  There are a lot of struggles in this book and some of the same faults that came up in the first book re-appear. Adam is still very controlling (which can be frustrating as a reader) but Mia is still trying to do everything on her own as well. Both need to learn how to let others in and trust them.  It does help to understand Adam better when you hear his thoughts.  It does drag a little in the middle where you wonder what in the world is happening but all the questions raised in this book do get explained by the end. Fair warning there is a cliffhanger.

B00A1B6S6S,A33I6PERQJQ2TR,"12 6, 2012",Sam,A Sexual Fantasy Come to Life,"The story of Iliana and Nickolas is actually told in a number of parts. The two face a lot of challenges in coming together however throughout the course of this series they are able to overcome many things and do just that. In this book, the third installment, they are again faced with challenges and secrets that could easily drive a wedge between them if they let it.This book is focused on romance and secrets. The two people obviously care very much for each other and want their relationship to work. Nickolas refers to her as his 'kitty' often and doesn't want to reveal his secret for fear of losing her which makes it obvious she means something and she is willing to trust him which betrays her feelings as well. The romance of this story is therefore easily determined. However Nickolas is keeping a big secret from her that could destroy everything.The style of writing that is offered in this book is very good and very specific. Everything is described in detail and offers a good point of view. This includes the sex scenes of course as Sandra Ross is very eloquent with these parts of all of her books and knows what she's doing when she writes them.Anyone that likes a good supernatural romance will love all of the books in this series, as they are highly detailed and full of all the supernatural ideals that you could possibly need. These books are great for anyone who loves explicit stories as well since Ross knows how to write them so that you'll be reaching for water after the first couple lines.Nickolas and Iliana have been together for a while now (obviously since it's now book three) however there are still secrets between them that threaten to ruin everything. If they can't get rid of the secrets it may prove the ruin of their relationship before it even really begins. But the secrets themselves could tear them apart as well. It will be up to Nickolas to determine if he can trust her with his.I wish he would have told her his secret earlier so they could get back to the romance and the sex earlier on in the story but it all seemed to work out well in the end. They managed to recover from the entire ordeal quickly enough and everything got right back to normal.I definitely felt that this book was an erotic romance and I'm sure that anyone else will too. The information contained in here is not for anyone who is easily offended which definitely doesn't exclude my friends. This is something that anyone erotic romance lover should definitely read and pass on to their friends.",4

Her whole life she has been raised to be a demur Christian girl.  Always expected to be neither seen nor heard.  For sixteen years she has put her own dreams on hold and plays the part, until one day she fell in love with dance.  Dance became a secret passion, an outlet to be herself.  A way to break free of the restraints that bound her.Experiencing the freedom dance allows her, Grey was able to think clearly about what she wants in her life.  She is able to explore new interests, which leads to her love of videography and the desire to go to college far from the watchful eye of her father.  Sadly, her father believes the world of film and movies is filled with sin and is no place for his daughter.  Forbidding her to leave, Grey must choose, a quiet Baptist life potentially married to a pastor, like her mother, or fleeing to Los Angeles to pursue the life she dreams of.Standing up to her father wasn't easy, but when her life began to crumble around her and she was forced to make a decision, Grey follows her heart.  With only a few hundred dollars in her pocket she sets out to live her life her way for the first time ever.  Unfortunately, following your heart is never easy.  Life will try you are every bend and turn.  Grey's strength during this time was amazing, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.Now obviously the title of the book is Stripped, which implies stripping.  So how does a good southern girl end up in the gritty world of exotic dancing?  That is the dark story the author tells.  However, even in the darkest times there is always a glimmer of hope.  For Grey that glimmer is Dawson.Dawson grew up as a privileged L.A. brat.  He has always had everything he could want.  Lavish homes.  Fast cars.  Beautiful woman.  The one thing that has always been missing is love.  Lost in an emotionless world, Dawson turns to acting in a quest to feel something, anything.  Pretending to be a character on set allows him a small taste of the emotional connection he craves.  Dawson is drifting through his life until the night he meets Grey.  Watching her sway her hips he is hypnotized.  When he looks into her eyes he can see the innocence and knows she doesn't belong in that dingy place.  He feels the need to pull her from Hell.  He feels...  His whole life he had been empty, but one look at Grey and he feels emotion bubble in his chest.I really liked Dawson's character.  He was more than a pretty face.  Despite his upbringing he was still a guys guy.  He enjoyed fast, loud, muscle cars and one too many beers on a Friday night.  Dawson has an air of alpha to him, but it wasn't too overbearing.  I enjoyed watching him breakdown the walls Grey had erected around her heart.  Grey was also an amazing character.  One would think that due to her upbringing she would be meek.  That was very far from the truth.  Beneath the ladylike exterior is a fighter.This was my first Jasinda Wilder book.  I liked her style and plot development.  I look forward to reading more of her novels in the future.Happy reading!![...]",4

Holliday Hughes is the creator of the very popular &#8220;Bite Me Lime&#8221; and is off to Vegas for a conference and a bit of a getaway vacation to let lose. That is where she meets Mr. Tall-Dark-Hottie, Jack Dalton, and the attraction between the two is instant. Using his smooth lines, he gets her attention and offers to buy her a drink, and maybe more.  Normally what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas but not with Holliday and Jack, after spending the weekend together and her getting to know the real Jack Dalton a bit better, they decide that they want even more, and continue to see were this will take them, they are not ready for this to be over. But living in different places, having lives that were completely different, could they really do more?Holliday was a really good character, for once it was nice to see a successful and independent business woman as the lead female character rather than the normal broken timid girl that most stories have. I enjoyed her interaction with her friends and with Jack, she was loving and sweet and lots of fun. Jack was a mix of things, he had a little bit alpha male to him, a sweet and tender side but also showing a bit of a darker side to him. I must say these two characters were good characters and did have great chemistry, but I struggled to connect with them, I liked them but just didn&#8217;t love them.This book was a well written enjoyable read that had a great mix of some fun banter, lots of hot sex and some angst added. Although for me, like with the characters, I struggled to connect to their story and their love, it felt too insta-love  for me.  I lovea hot sexy holiday hook up that has great chemistry, but their strong feelings for each other just came way too quick for me. I would have loved to see more build up to those feelings rather than them be feeling the way they did just after 2 days in Vegas. I also found myself wanting more from the story. When these two were together, all they basically did was have sex, when they were apart all they did was say how much they missed each other, I wanted to see more depth with their feelings and story.I did enjoy the storyline and the few twists the author added to it, I just found it fell flat for me at times and come the end, was left feeling that the book had so much more potential but just didn&#8217;t reach it. Final thought, The Resistance was a good enjoyable read I liked, sadly with seeing all the great 5 star initial ratings, I went into this book expecting it to be a great one that I was going to love.*received a complimentary copy from the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review*",4

B008RYSZJE,A26Q3M35ZVU1ZN,"06 2, 2013","Crystal R. ""Crystal R.""",I was Awakened !,"My Rant: Captivating, This story has completely taking me by surprise. In the beginning you have a broken and lost Lilly trying to survive in a world that makes no sense to her. People are cruel and the way they use each other just makes her disgust them more. After the death of her mother Lily completely closes herself off from others emotionally. She is lost, afraid and longing. I thought this book would be about a women trying to get over her past and that she found someone that loved her and could provide the comfort she needed, so we are introduced to Ethan, who appeared to be the night in shinning armour for our Lilly.What I found interesting about this book is that you are lead to believe in the lie of Lilly life, or the cover up pertaining to the death of Lilly's mother. The author takes you through Lilly's pain be rehashing her past through dreams. At first I thought I could not connect with Lilly. I felt she was so depressed and repressed that it was hard to make that connection with her. I was completely wrong. Under the complexity of the story I began to admire Lily and her courage. But this is after Torren steps into Lilly's life.Torren completely unravels Lilly which brings  her out of her shell and at this point I am loving Lilly's transformation. I am understanding her, connecting with her and sharing in her emotions.  I have to blink at myself because I did not expect to feel this way about Lilly. The author has caught me emotionally without me knowing I was caught. As the story continues the author switched the tone of the story. Everything is not what it appears to be and the real knight in shinning amour turns out to be a vampire. I am so blushing right now because I love my vamps especially the ones that wear their hearts on their sleeves, just like Torren.Torren actions begins to through this story into a whirlwind and I am so connected at this point i am just holding on to enjoy the ride. In the end we are left with a sexy Torren and a stronger Lilly that you are yearning to know whats going to happen next. What will come next in the Lilly Frank Series now that she has found herself. I guess we will have to wait until the next installment is out.My Recommendation:I enjoyed the authors writing style and the way she formed Lilly's story to catch the readers while they least expect it was tremendously and influence to my review rating. I rated this book 4 out of 5 Purple Rant Hearts and I would recommend this book  to paranormal book lovers.FTC Disclaimer:  I received this book for free from the author, editor, publisher, or Promo Host.

And here, Thea Harrison proves that she can rock my world, even with a scant 70 pages of a novella.This story focuses on a wolf-shifter named Gideon. He's a detective who investigates Wyr-related crimes. And now he is on the hunt for a serial killer. It's at a crime scene that he first crosses paths with Alice. She was friends with the latest victim. At first, he thinks to just question her as a witness, but as soon as they come face-to-face, they realize they are mates. The rest of the story follows the couple as they work to figure out who the killer is --and, of course, as they accept each other as mates.Even though the story is short, it follows a solid path and has a firm conclusion.  It features cameo appearances by a few of the characters we have come to know in earlier books, but it works very easily as a standalone.  And it has the trademark smoking-hot bedroom action that I have come to love and expect from Harrison.  (Granted, the sex was on the living room floor, but when it's that good, I'm not picky.)  I liked the fact that Gideon was a younger Wyr than those we've known in the past, which made him a little more relatable, while still deliciously alpha.  I loved how he treats Alice; how they are together.  It was all... very satisfying.A great addition to the series.  A little more than 4 stars.",4

Second, others are just upset because they did not read the desciption of the book before downloading it. The comments specifically say that this is one scene (and not chapter) written from Four's perspecitive. This is a great scene for her to do in Four's view too. Later in Divergent they discuss how he taunted her when throwing the knives. When reading this tidbit from Four's perspective you can see exactly what he is thinking and why. It is really great. When reading Divergent I did not know when Four developed an interest in Tris. This gives some great information from Four's view, which is not offerred in Divergent, which is all from Tris's point of view. I just want more. It would have been great if this was longer, but I get it. She is busy working on the 3rd book, which I can't wait to read!!! I love Four (sorry I like calling him Four way better than calling him Tobias), and I think he is one of my favorite characters. Plus when reading this peice you get some background information on Four's initation, as well as his dynamic with Eric.

We begin with the team leader, Timothy Santos's story. He has come back home in undercover operation to bring down a Mexican cartel drug lord as well as find out what happened to his informant who was on the inside. He stumbles on to is former lover, the sheriff of the town, Rose Renwick, pinned down by gunfire in a remote location. He tries to explain what is going on, but Rose isn't believing him.Rose Renwick feels her former lover only cares about one thing, catching the bad guy by any means possible. When she discovers he is using her black sheep mother, things go from the frying pan in to the fire. The trail leads over the border to Mexico where Rose discovers her mother and his informant are one and the same.I have to say, I'm not sure I would have given Timothy nearly as much trust as Rose does, even hesitatingly. For a while his lies to her were compounding and I was doubting they would get together but the author managed to believably bring Timothy around to some self-discovery. Texas Hold `Em is heavier on the suspense side than the romance side, but that's the way I like it. I enjoy a lot of action in my romantic suspenses.

They are both new authors to me, but I found great ones.Davi, a human and one of the best blacksmiths around was taught the trade by his father doesn't really fit in with his own people and soon finds himself on a journey.In this book the humans and dwarves do not really get along that being said the trade routes between Kronthor and Davi's home Hoon, have been cut off for some time and the people of Hoon are running low on food. This is where Xeric introduces his idea of sending Davi to Kronthor to reopen the trade routes.This begins one of the best short fantasy novella I have read in a while, it kind of reminded me of a mix up between Lord of the Rings and the Artemis Fowl series but still managing to be unique in its own right.The people of Davi's town Hoon, well the one introduced to us any way, Xeric. I didn't really like him, he was mean to Davi, for no reason that I saw and had only, I believe, interest for himself, no one else.Davi does go to the Kronthor and he finds the acceptance there that he did not find with his own people. I really liked this, how Davi found himself with the dwarves and basically starts a life, and he does accomplish what he set out to do of course there is a lot more to the book than that.This is the first book in the series, and I do hope that a second will be coming along soon.

I normally do not add in any judgments on the cover of a book, (and it played no part in my scoring), however this cover I find a bit deceptive. I mention it as I think if you look at the cover you may judge it to be about older teens. It is about sixth graders so older teens need to be aware of that. They may be expecting something with more angst than this story delivers. This book is more the anxiety and the bittersweet angst of first crushes.

It takes you on a sexy, gritty, heart breaking ride.I was not prepared for the story when I started this book.  I was expecting a different, maybe more run of the mill erotic romance.  I was so pleasantly surprised by the roller coaster of emotions this tale spun me on.This is the story of Sebastian and Rosslyn.  Roz is a young woman who has been forced through the circumstances that life has thrown at her to grow up quicker than she should have.  Sebastian could help to solve her problems with his indecent proposal.Sebastian seems from the beginning to be a wealthy, broken person who refuses to become emotionally attached to anyone.

The characters were vibrant and entertaining, exactly what I've come to expect and appreciate from Bennett. The love story was short, but just enough to make me believe in their relationship and root for them. This was a sweet and touching read that I simply loved.Jack and Hope were great characters. I loved that Jack was not only charming and sexy, but also sweet and caring. I didn't expect him to be so considerate, but he definitely didn't hold anything back when it came to Hope. I'll admit, there was one part that was a bit too touching for me, but that's more a personal preference, and I'm sure others will find it endearing. Either way, Jack is a guy after my own heart. Hope was fun and kind of reminded me of myself, in that she's not very adventurous or outgoing. She was definitely a likable character. Jack brings out the vixen in Hope and I loved watching them explore each other both physically and emotionally.If you're looking for a quick holiday romance with fun characters, then this is the book for you. Sawyer always grabs me with her writing and If I Return is no different. Sawyer blended in a good mix of sweet times and sexy times, with just enough substance to make this a great story. I swear, this lady can do no wrong!",4
B00BOVLVCU,A36R1GGNDJ0R5I,"05 1, 2013",aries_BLU,"Nicely written, though annoying as heck heroine","I actually read this book after I read the second installment of this series,Scarlet Heat (Born to Darkness), and I glad I did. It was not horrible, but the heroine at times made it unbearable. There were times that Addison seriously got on my nerves, and I did not understand Corbin's fasciation with her. He truly was a patient individual. My frustration came from her stupidity, or naivet&eacute;, and her selfishness. I understood that she felt guilty, but she was not at all realistic of the situation. It is as if she was blind to danger, and did not care the consequences her actions had on other people, i.e. Corbin, and even at times her best friend Taylor.I was able to get a gist of her personality in the second book, but to me this was a full on gust of wind in this one. At times I was like, girl! Seriously! Come on! I understand she had loyalty, but it was as if she had it only for Taylor and herself. A lot of us may not like certain people, maybe even to the point of detesting them, but we still know how to at least fake it. Even if we do not feel like faking it, we know how and when we should. She didn't! Even though she is not real, that is something that I really did not like about her, because she was aware of the stakes when it came to certain people, and it was as if she did not care that she could have ruined Corbin's life, even to the point of him not having one. That was beyond it for me, and therefore solidified it, for me, how much of an unlikeable character she was.Aside from that, the story was nicely written and super easy to follow. To be honest, even though she has great stories I wish this is how Laurann Dohner would write. Even if you do not like certain characters, you can always appreciate the written talent of Evangeline Anderson and how fluidly realistic her style is.",4

I liked it developing over a long period of time instead of insta-love.

It is definitely a wonderful beginning of a series for fans of the urban fantasy genre and I really enjoyed the world building and the protagonist's search for his identity.  In my mind he is a bit Dresdenesque and if you are a fan of that series The Generalist has great possibilities.  This was a short read, but is packed with nonstop action to the point where I did not notice, other than wanting more.  The only thing that bothered me was some of the slang or ""ghetto"" speak by the main character at the beginning of the story.  The character has amnesia and is struggling to find out who he is; however, he is very smart and in my opinion it makes the story less believable, and it is for this reason I gave the story 4 stars rather than the 5 I would have likely rated it otherwise.  This tones down as the story progresses and it is a much more enjoyable to read as this occurs.  I love the peripheral characters who are a fun and unique group of folks that I want to get to know more.  I am looking forward to reading more from this series and have high hopes for a great ride.

B00ES2GHDA,A2L8P8TR1VYGH7,"09 16, 2013",techieteacher,Enchanting co-author debut! Polished and deeply emotional!,"Nocturne is a lyrical novel of passion translated through music.  Gregory Fitzgerald is a world renowned cellist.  Music is his life and nothing is more important to him than his seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar cello - until he meets Savannah Marshall.  Gregory's arrogance is unsurpassed and few have impressed him as much as gifted student flutist Savannah Marshall.  Savannah grew up as a child of music royalty.  It's in her blood.  As a part of the New England Conservatory of Music's freshman class, she's ready to push limits and make a name for herself.... even if it means going up against the attractive and enigmatic Professor Fitzgerald.I absolutely love books that have a slow, steady build up.  It's great to find yourself so attached to a book that you physically feel your heart clench while reading it. Many of the most captivating  scenes are when Savannah and Gregory speak to each other through their music.  Their passion, heartache, anger, hurt, apologies, and love come to the surface through their duets.  Something completely magical occurs when they share their feelings with each other in front of live audiences - speaking in a language that only the two of them can understand.  I could feel the electricity and chemistry between the characters.  Savannah and Gregory have an intense connection that is felt deep in their soul and translates right off the pages of this captivating novel.  Savannah and Gregory's love story is a journey spanning almost a decade and they always seem to be racing against the clock when they are together. One of my favorite lines in the book is ""Go slow.  I don't want this to end.""  As their forbidden attraction comes to the surface lines will be crossed and reputations will be called into question.I've long been a fan of Charles Sheehan-Miles' books.  The Thompson Sisters is one of my favorite series.  You can always count on him to deliver a deeply emotional story - and this book did not disappoint.  I have not yet had the pleasure of reading any of Andrea Randall's backlist - but I'm happy to report that they just moved up on my to be read list!  I'm also happy to report that this book was a very seamless and polished read for a co-authored book.Four stars from me for this enchanting co-author debut!  Pick up your copy today and enjoy!

B00I1VX9YO,A2MHRBM9MKRNTN,"02 24, 2014",K. Bias,4 to 4.5 stars. Loved Quinn!,"We met Quinn the keyboardist for Shaken Dirty in book one Crash Into Me and I have to say he did not make a big impression on me in that one. I remember getting to the review and I was trying to think of something to say about him, but there really wasn't anything that stood out. That was probably because the other guys in the band all had major issues going on so they were more dramatic. But from the beginning of this book, I really liked him.As kids and teens, Quinn Bradford and Elise McKinnon were piano playing rivals that constantly tried to out do each other, pull pranks and generally irritate each other. But they were also friends and turned into more as they got older. But it ended when they were seventeen and were left broken hearted especially Elise.Ten years later, Elise has suffered injuries and loss in a car accident. Quinn comes to the hospital and as they are reunited for the first time, they immediately spark. Quinn has a lot going on in his life. His band Shaken Dirty is struggling a bit due to interpersonal battles and Wyatt in rehab. But Elise has had a hard year and has no one else, so Quinn decides he is stepping in whether she wants him to or not. There's a thin line between providing help and kidnapping.(Quote)That sweetly polished boy was long gone and in his place was a man who exuded sex--raw, primitive, raunchy sex--with every move, every word, every breath.We see not only Quinn the rockstar, but we also get to see where he has come from and how his past has changed him. With his success he could be a real jerk, but he is caring, considerate, and really jumps in to take care of his old friend. He can tell that there's more wrong with her then just her accident and he can see through to her pain that she's trying to hide. He is sensitive when he needs to be and pushes her when she needs it as well . His feelings for her are all tied up in the past as well as a continued attraction in the present. They have a definite connection and chemistry, but they both have reasons not to act on it. She is just getting over a major trauma as well as multiple losses. She has major trust issues based on their relationship in the past. And he has never felt worthy of her and has issues from his past that have caused him to think negatively about himself. And even though he is now successful those insecurities are still there. He shattered her heart and changed the way that she views the world and caused her to put up big walls. He hurt himself in the process too, but thought it was best for her. But now in the present they revert to some of their flirty, fun, antagonistic banter and also try to push away their attraction to each other.Their sparring is engaging, taunting, and laced with an underlying need for attention. The jokes they played on each other are interesting and humorous. They ooze sexual tension and chemistry. Oh, the foreplay! They have a shared history and they both have suffered loss and are broken in some ways. She resists but really does not want to. He pushes more but knows that he shouldn't. She is lonely and has walls up and lacks emotional connections. He has never felt worthy of her and has made mistakes. They are quite the dysfunctional pair. But they really do fit well together. They are put back in each other's lives at a time were they both needed it. The future of his band and career is all up in the air and they are all scrambling to get it together. She is trying to figure out what her own future will consist of since the one thing she truly loves and has always been an integral part of her has been snatched away. And despite their playfulness and pranks, they both tend to have an understanding and calming presence on each other.(Quote)He wanted to take her apart as she'd done to him, wanted to put her back together--put them both back together--in a way that took everything she had to give but gave her everything of him as well.It basically all boils down to trust, fear, and insecurities. Do they care enough and are they brave enough to try to do better this time and not hurt each other again? He worries so much about hurting her and she frets about getting hurt again, but their protective actions do just that. They avoid and run at times. So they are self fulfilling prophecies. They need to trust and believe in each other and themselves in order to even attempt to move forward.I loved getting more with the band Ryder, Jared, and Wyatt(Micah..not so much) and Ryder's fiance/Jared's sister, Jamison from Crash Into Me. Their interactions were funny and taunting and they had me smiling often. But they were also truly supportive of each other too and act like a family. This one was sweet, sexy, funny, and engaging. I actually liked it better than the first book. I was sucked in and enjoyed being back with the Shaken Dirty gang and I look forward to more stories especially Jared and Wyatt.Thanks to Brazen, Entangled Publishing, and Tracy Wolff for providing me with an arc copy in exchange for an honest review.",4

Like her earlier novelette, DRAWING CLOSER, the newly released MISTAKEN ENGAGEMENT is a power packed read, an emotional, romantic story which will give you all the satisfaction of a romance novel in a smaller package.  In today's activity filled lifestyle, it's nice to think that you can still get a satisfying read in a more compact package. As my late, beloved grandmother used to say, ""good goods come in small packages.""This is Saul and Grace's story. As they are step cousins, Saul has been in love with Grace ever since she joined his family after her mother married Saul's uncle.  Seeing Grace a little hurt and humiliate when the man she likes chooses her more glamorous step sister over her, Saul charges to the rescue by announcing their 'engagement.'  Grace is not impressed.  According to her, the engagement is so not happening.  Saul fixes it for Grace to come away for the long Australia Day weekend.

B0088NH1K8,A2LPUUPO1WL9MG,"08 23, 2012",Slick Reads,Really enjoyed this one!,"My review from GuiltyPleasuresbookreviews.comI have to admit that I get a little ""thrill"" every time I read a new to me author.  It's kind of like meeting a new person and wondering if you'll be able to be friends with them or if it's better to stick them in the ""acquaintance"" corner.  I'm pretty excited that after reading Planning for Love, I plan to put Christi Barth into the friend's column.  Planning for Love is an intriguing tale of a wedding planner, Ivy Rhodes, who not only believes in happily she promotes it day in and day out and Bennett Westcott, a journalist/cameraman, who doesn't believe in romance or marriage.  Yes, these two are on opposite ends of the spectrum and watching them is one fun, sexy, and rewarding task.Right off the bat I fell in love with these characters, both completely locked in to only seeing things their way but instant attraction that can't be denied.  Ivy is shocked to learn one of her brides has agreed to be on a reality show Wild Wedding Smackdown and while she'd love to kill the bearer of that news, Bennett (Ben) she knows it's not his fault.  She manages to get through the day with her ever present grace and charm and then Ben manages to charm her panties right off.  Ivy although completely likeable seems to be a bit nave when it comes to men and relationships, but I'm guessing it might come with the profession.  When you are around happy couples and weddings all the time, it's probably a safe bet that you sometimes see what you want.  After spending a night and a day with Ben, he starts to pull back and while he thinks he did the right thing by walking away, Ivy is crushed.When Ben returns for work purposes, it becomes even more evident the chemistry is still there but so is the hurt and uncertainty.  Both Ivy and Ben, being professionals, manage to come to agreement about their past not interfering with their working relationship.  Soon Ben, whether he realizes it or wants to admit it, is romancing Ivy.  Ivy of course picks up on it and decides to try and win Ben's affections once and for all.  With the help of her crazy and nutty staff she starts planning her mission.  Ben on the other hand who's been a loner most of his adult life finds himself with an odd assortment of friends; friends who not only figure out his professional shame, but sympathize with him because of it.Ben and Ivy spend a lot of time together and really get to know each other well but they never end up back in bed.  That is something Ivy has decided against and Ben although not totally on board with the decision, respects it.  Ivy's feelings continue to grow and she admits to herself she's fallen in love with Ben, she of course doesn't tell Ben because she knows it will flip him out.  We know Ben feels something for Ivy but he's so closed off and so anti love that it's hard to know what he's thinking or feeling.This is a romance pure and simple but this story is about all kinds of relationships and that makes it special.  The story line is amazingly complex and interesting, the dialog moves at a good pace and it's funny when appropriate and serious when it needs to be, but it's the entire cast of characters that makes this book so intriguing. This is absolutely a group of people that I would like to know and spend time with.  Planning for Love is the first book in The Aisle Bound Trilogy and I am already anticipating the next release.",4

Snow Day by Dan Maurer was an excellent read.  It's not long - I read it in the course of two evenings.  This novella brought back a lot of childhood memories.  Oh, how we looked forward to snow days.  I also remember that my sister and I could run around town and there were never any fears of anything bad happening to us and that's really what this story is about.  The story starts with a horrifying discovery and then backtracks to the beginning and leads up to the discovery and the aftermath.  Snow Day is wonderfully written and the descriptions so vivid that you can easily imagine being right there with Billy, the main character in the story.  I loved that in the afterword, the author tells how that a comment by a childhood friend about having an idyllic childhood is how he came up with the story as he posed the question, did we really?  The story did not exactly have a happy ending but the ending was very satisfying.  If you love horror with a touch of paranormal, I would highly recommend this title.  I cannot wait to read more of Dan Maurer's work.",4

With that said, the story itself was charming.  Duncan MacDougall is a half fae scottish laird trying to quiet his otherworldly nightmares.  His answer comes not from a legendary bow, but from a most unexpected beautiful woman.  Lady Alana is the unwitting hostage stuck between two waring brothers.  I enjoyed the characters, Duncan had to hide his hurt, and fought between falling in love and fighting his nightmares.  Alana proved to be a strong heroine.  She stood up to Duncan's domineering ways and brought out the more sensitive man he was hiding.  In the end, the characters learn, grow, and do what's right by each other.

She didn't feel bad about taking care of her, but now she intends on finding our what not being a virgin is all about. Everyone knows everyone in her small town, even sharing women was the norm in Law Castle.  Who does Cheryl pick to give her virginity to? No one else but the towns most infamous bad boys Noah and Drew.Noah and Drew lived as they wanted(mostly being man whores smiles), they honed their reputation and saw it as a badge of honor. That reputation may just be their undoing. They are best friends, and have shared everything including women. They've set their eyes on Cheryl, all three have no each other so its not like they are strangers.Wonders which to think 1) its the male ego about how &#8220;big&#8221; he is, or 2) not knowing a woman's body well enough to know she was  a virgin. *Giggles * Because of that the new non virgin flies the coup the next morning, when both of the men are still asleep. Cheryl knows they don't keep a girl over night, they don't do commitment, they do move on. She has decided to do the moving on herself. Of course since Noah and Drew are such connoisseurs of women's flesh, they wont mind in the least that Cheryl has taken herself out of the equation.Hi five to the Author, there is nothing negative I could say about this book. The storyline flowed great, each character fit. A menage relationship can be difficult, the way Noah and Drew were already friends went along way in tamping down jealousy. You can feel the passion, the care, the love that was developing between all three (even if the characters didn&#8217;t &#8211; smiles) A hint of BDSM, that would have been fun to see expanded. Along with some yummie hot scenes, yeah Id recommend this book. Read and enjoy.",4

B00AJD037S,A39B4H20EJ9PMT,"01 28, 2013",Jessica's Book Review,"Holy Sexual Build-Up Ladies!! Very charming, easy read.","Nice Girl by Kate Baum had me very intrigued after reading the synopsis of the novel.  I like the idea of a shy girl moving to a big city and making her own way and I am also very interested in the Criminology aspect of the book since it was Grace's degree.The book starts off with being introduced to Grace and her three girlfriends.  I loved their open and honest relationship discussing sex and their lack of sex with college boys. All four girls have never experienced the big ""O"" and vowed to get their ""O"" within a year. Grace gets accepted to a graduate college in NYC and makes the big leap from her small Midwestern town to the big city. Grace wants to become a different woman in this new big town. She changes her appearance and gains more confidence in herself by losing weight and wants to take more leaps with men. Grace accepts a job in a Private Investigator's office and meets a group of hilarious men. I adored Jamie, a co-worker in her new office and his boyfriend Luke. I think every girl needs a gay guy around and they brought in some comic relief. Anthony, the part owner who I think could carry a book on his own I would enjoy reading, and then there is Vinnie... the other part owner of the P.I. company who is 6'4 of hunkiness with a shady past of his own full of issues and crime.First let me say... holy moly sexual build-up people! Grace and Vinnie have instant sexual heat sizzling through my kindle. I just couldn't stop reading the book waiting for these two to finally get it on and let Grace have that ""O"" she so much deserves. Every time I thought it was happening, it didn't. The wait was killing me! I think I wanted it for them as badly as they wanted it for themselves. I just loved how over protective Vinnie became in Grace and how you could read the change in Vinnie as he started to fall for Grace.The entire book had my complete interest; I did not find it to be slow in any parts. The dialogue was not cheesy the plot was well played out. I did find there were spelling errors and missing words in sentences but nothing then a good edit couldn't fix. There were times I was hoping for more in scenes or in small characters; for example Mark. Another graduate student in Grace's class who is a police officer. I was hoping he would have a bigger part of the book. Maybe more of a suitor for Grace or possibly he knew Vinnie and his shady past, but his character came and went and I was a bit disappointed. This is all small things that can be overlooked because Nice Girl is a really a great book!New Girl is the first book in the Girls series by Ms. Baum. The next three books will follow Grace's friends and their hope to find their ""O"" and perfect mates. As I mentioned earlier in my review I think given an opportunity, Anthony could make a wonderful book. He is very interesting... yes interesting is a perfect word for him.  ;)I give Nice Girl 4 Stars.** A copy of this book was provided by the author in return for an honest review. **",4

I may have skipped a few of the recent paranormal hits (Twilight, Hunger Games, etc), but I stumbled across this inexpensive eBook and decided to give it a try. While there were plenty of moments where I felt a bit out of my element, I enjoyed the character development and the lighthearted feel to the plot progression. Beaty showed her depth as an author when the suspense and the danger began to build, and just like many great authors, she was able to maintain tension without the reader losing interest, despite the occasional moments of humor or levity that were thrown in as infrequent respites. I almost with the book had centered on Ornella, or there should at least be a spin-off book about her life and times, as she was easily the most interesting and unique character that seemed to dominate any scene she was in. If this book had been a movie, she would have stolen the show. Hanna was a bit too filled with &#34;angst&#34; for me to properly identify with her or engage with her emotionally, but the story as a whole was enough to lead me on bit by bit. Eventually, when I came to the end, I realized that it had been a well-rounded, clearly outlined story without too many twists and turns, but also with very few obvious &#34;mistakes&#34;. While I may not suggest this at my next reading club meeting, it was certainly a good book to while away a few afternoons with. Nicely done, Ms. Beaty.",4

It's mid-April in the Hudson River Valley, a week before her seventeenth birthday, and the robins always return before her birthday.So where are they? What about the bird feeder? It hasn't had any visitors for weeks? And where's the morning birdcall, the normal ""chip and chant, twitter and gurgle, slur and rasp"" that greets the sunrise?In ""The Fall of the Birds,"" as in any good yarn the suspense builds incrementally, uncertainty then unease gradually give way to menace and dread that becomes the fear that things are going to get really bad.The narrator of ""Fall of the Birds,"" is a insurance company claims adjuster. Caitlan is his stepdaughter. They're both grieving the recent death of Caitlan's mother. Both stepfather and stepdaughter are birders, knowledgeable about the birds around them and keen observers of avian habits and habitats.When for no explainable reason birds begin dropping from the sky like gilded stones and when vagrant species of birds not normally seen anywhere near the Northeast begin congregating outside the window, the world seems to have titled on its axis and the alarm becomes palpable.We're reminded that canaries went down into the mines for good reason and ultimately we're asked to consider if what's happening to the birds is a harbinger for humans. It's something unbalancing, a cause for unease.Morrow's style to some may seem fussy. His vocabulary often relies on words such as palaver, vicissitudes and macadam. In his Amazon review (above) Jason Kirk says Morrow's language is ""gravid yet light."" The story is written in the first person. It's a good choice for a voice that's eloquent, descriptive.A theme is the resilience of the human spirit. The birds are dying and a father and daughter are grieving over the death of their wife and mother. The future is uncertain.

Having done so I have to say that I have mixed feelings about the series.For the most part it is a very engrossing Space Opera with the larger than (two or three) life characters. There are the starships with characters of their own, there are classic heroes and dastardly villains all jammed together in a galactic conflict between freedom and enslavement.The sections of the story that involved the doings aboard the starships and among the crews of the good guys held my interest easily while the interactions and plotting of the bad guys bored me to tears.Some of the plot details were difficult to follow and I found myself just taking things at face value rather than worrying about what happened to cause this or that.The concept of some of the characters dying and then having their consciousness` downloaded into a new body takes some getting used to.This series has been out for a few years so I won't harp on the typos and grammatical and syntax errors except to say that there are quite a few but not so many that they detract from the story. I will call the author to task for using the the word ""dampening"", which means to get slightly wet, for the word ""damping"" which means to subdue or muffle.Overall I have to commend the author for writing a whopper of a tale. I was thoroughly entertained and in the end, that's the ultimate goal of any book. By that measure, the Spinward Fringe series of books are a success!",4

And I appreciate that she maintains consistency throughout all her books. It's not like you get to one part of the trilogy/quartet, etc. and think what was that all about?

I get the general idea, but there are few things that could have been clarified a bit more. Maybe with additional readings, I'll get it all.Nay:I was a little bit tired of having Rayla being bonded to so many people and have it go back and forth throughout 4 novels. I kind of felt like that was dragging the story. I was sold on Heath, and wanted them together, all the time, so when I another distraction popped up, I was like ""ugh, not again. Need. More. Heath."" Also, I thought in a previous book, they said that the link between Rayla and Heath was stronger than between her and any other lord, (I think this was in the previous book where they were talking about linking the 5 of them up) so... what happened in this story? It appears that there was a continuity lapse. Also, Heath doesn't really fight that hard to get what he wants, which is pretty surprising to me and seems out of character for someone so in love.Also, I would love to see ""chuckle,"" used less often. The word is on every other page.I'm also a little dismayed that this is not the end. I like a series to have finality.

When Dori starts dating Tor and notices his avoidance of water she begins to wonder if maybe the sightings of mermaids were real after all. And he is causing a reaction in her to come to the surface that she never knew was possible.Tor was your usual sweet, hunky, and mysterious love interest.

But I also loved Colby. I'm a huge sucker for the best friend left behind but Colby was a jerk to Dori during certain parts. I understood his hurt but after a life long friendship I was sad that he turned his back on her. He does come through for another important part and made my heart ache for him again.

There were times that I really had to pay attention, obviously needing some of the backstory and world building from book one, and would recommend it be read first.  I enjoyed the characters, who fascinated me with each introduction.  There were those I cheered on and others I reveled in their takedown.  The world building was grand and the pacing like a riverboat ride through the bayou with many little tributaries shooting off with each new revelation, betrayal, and suspenseful turn.

B00JPOEZIU,A2NCF5CFEH4JAA,"04 20, 2014",Ghoulish Gretl,Give Geekrotica a Try,"The Superfox is a little bit longer, a little bit edgier, and a little bit pop-culture-reference-ier than the Lumberfox, the first story in Lovelace's Geekrotica series. Like the Lumberfox, it's set during this winter's Snowpocolypse in Atlanta, this time with the characters snowed in at work. Melissa is a project manager on a deadline who thinks she's alone in the office until she stumbles on enigmatic photographer Mark. The two have immediate chemistry, but they build up to the big event with their comic-infused banter. The author does a good job making the characters, and the sex, real and believable.The superhero references start flowing right away, but as long as you've seen The Avengers I wouldn't worry too much about getting lost. Though some X Men might help too. My favorite movie reference though (maybe ever) was one that had nothing to do with superheroes. I'll let you spot it for yourself.I think the charm of this series comes from making subjects that are often intimidating accessible. Erotica makes a lot of people nervous. So does geek culture. People are afraid of being judged either for knowing too much or for not knowing enough about each one. Somehow combining the two makes them both more relatable. If you're undecided about either subject, give Geekrotica a try. It's a lot of fun for very little investment of either time or money.I won this book in an online contest.",4

They are both so completely against being gay that they spend almost the entire story fighting it. And that&#8217;s just one of their issues! Jude is one messed up dude, and Slater isn&#8217;t much better. He has issues that go back to his childhood and branch out from there, making him a distant and very difficult to get to know person. Slater sees through most of that though, and the two form a friendship while sharing Levi&#8217;s townhouse. Of course, most of it is hot sex, but an underlying friendship blossoms as well.I had a very difficult time suspending my belief that two &#8220;straight&#8221; guys would ever act the way these two did. But putting that aside, they were unbelievably hot together. It definitely makes for a different kind of relationship and one that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever read about before.But, these guys aren&#8217;t the only ones here with issues. I think every couple in this story is going through one type of problem or another, both individually and as couples. Levi and Tracy, Bo and Dylan, etc., all had things going on. I kept thinking they could all benefit from some extensive group therapy, but they did eventually manage to work through some of their problems.I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of this series, starting with Bo and Dylan in Six Ways from Sunday. Unfortunately, I think they set the bar pretty high in their story, as I seem to not be enjoying the others quite as much. But quite a bit happens in Offside Chance, and it was great to see the others again. There are a few twists revealed, especially at the end, which I found surprising. So, this was a nice addition to the series, and I definitely look forward to seeing more from these guys now that they seem to have things on track.",4

Of course, in my true historical phobia fashion, I said no way! It&#8217;s historical, I don&#8217;t like those&#8230; right? Obviously not because I read it and LOVED IT!Lucien Vaudrey spent the last twenty years exiled in China. When he received notice that his father and brother both died suddenly and that he needed to come back to deal with the estate, he expects to come into contact with his family&#8217;s enemies. What he doesn&#8217;t expect is to be cursed. Forced into seeking assistance from a magical practitioner, he meets Stephen Day, a man who holds a grudge against the Crane family. While Stephen wants to hate Crane, he can&#8217;t seem to not offer his assistance. In his attempt to free Crane from his curse, he uncovers a much more sinister plot behind the assassination attempts while slowly falling for the very man he doesn&#8217;t want to be attracted to.I really enjoyed this story not just because of the writing and the mystery but also because of the characters. The tension between Stephen and Crane in the beginning is potent and as that angry aggression lessens, a sexual tension takes over instead. The two together are HOT and I loved that there was such a build up to their attraction before anything major happened. As individuals, Crane is almost drowning in the chaos that his father and brother left behind, subjected to constant scorn just for being a Vaudrey. Stephen is guilty of blaming Crane for the sins of his father but learns quickly that Crane is nothing like family. I loved that the story showed the development of Stephen&#8217;s feelings towards Crane but also the way he sticks up for Crane to others who still believe that if he&#8217;s a Vaudrey he&#8217;s trouble. It was interesting to see the changing dynamics in the intimate relationship between Stephen and Crane, as well as, the magical aspects around the two.I adored this story but there was one big niggle that I had. It seemed like whenever I really wanted to get details on a certain thing, the description around it would be vague or lack details on what happened or what was being said, etc. For instance, there was one part where Crane was being asked for his decision from the villain, he said something and the villain responded but we never &#8216;see&#8217; that response or the villain&#8217;s reaction to it, only a mention that the villain didn&#8217;t like Crane&#8217;s answer and goes crazy. There was also another memorable part where I wanted to have more explanation on a certain &#8216;shrine&#8217; (so to speak) but while it was mentioned as gruesome, it was vague in what it actually looked like. There were other parts similar to that vagueness and I found I missed not getting descriptions on those sections.In the end, though, I still loved this book. The raw connection between Stephen and Crane is fascinating, the writing is phenomenal and the suspense and action interspersed throughout the story had me on the edge of my seat for a good portion of the book. It&#8217;s an engaging novel that definitely captured my attention and held it until the last word. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading the next book in the series and seeing what Stephen and Crane get up to next!",4

It was also very much for me about not judging a book by its cover. And I don't me the cover of the book, I mean people.  This story has a surprising twist to it that I really didn't see coming.Summer feels betrayed by her mother after coming home on college break to find her mother has already moved out and moved... Her parents whom she always thought had the perfect relationship are now divorcing and her father seems to be all to ok with the situation for Summer's liking.  She pretty much takes the bitterness and holds the axe over her mothers head.  Determined to cut her out of her life for her failings as a wife and a mother.  Summer is pretty bitter about the whole situation, she leaves behind her dream of a city job and the perfect boyfriend to move back to her dads farm and take care of him and the job her mother has left vacant.Ford's a wanderer.  He's flitting through life living a day at a time and planting roots everywhere he goes.  But these aren't roots in his life these are literally his plants.  His job is an interesting one to say the very least.  He is cross pollinating plants trying to develop versatile herbs that double as food with healing properties... He's brilliant literally but honestly.  I really would have liked to have seen a lot more of this unique aspect of the book, I found the little we did get fascinating and something we haven't seen before.  When Ford meets Summer something in him changes.  But he is solid in his decision that he isn't going to put down real roots anywhere he is still determined that the life that his father chose is not what he wants for himself.Overall I really enjoyed the book.  There are some twists that I really didn't see coming and then there were just a few things that I think were overlooked and could have had a lot more detail.  The first half of the book was just a little slow but it was enough to keep me reading and it was worth it in the end.  I really did love Ford's character, he was quite unique in many ways, which is something hard to come by, he's not a tattoed rocker or a bad boy he's charming and sweet and likes to have fun.  Summer and Ford have good chemistry and though they fight it you can't help denying what's meant to be.  Love will always find a way to break down barriers and walls that we put up to protect ourselves.  In the end the question is, is Love enough?  With these two you'll have to read to find out.... I give this one 4 stars.  It was a sweet read...",4

I think that, as with many books, the enjoyment is determined as much by the reader's expectations as by the book itself.These ghost stories are not scary, for the most part. They're atmospheric, thoughtful...someone else's review called them ""contemplative,"" and I like that description a lot. Anyone looking for a ""horror"" book will be disappointed.

This book was a little sci-fi mixed with romance. I don't normally enjoy that in a story but the story was interesting and the relationship between the hero & heroine took precedence. Warriors from the planet Harcos Prime police the solar system in exchange for natural resources including women. There is a ""Grab"" every quarter - women picked from a town or village run and the warriors race to catch them and claim them as mates. Naya has no desire to be caught by a warrior - even if it might mean a change for the better. However, when her friend Jennie's name is picked in a lottery and chosen to run in an upcoming Grab, she takes steps to be there to help her friend. For a woman who was abandoned and betrayed from a young age, Naya takes a great risk out of loyalty to a friend. Of course she winds up grabbed by Menace. Sparks fly right away. Naya finds him attractive but the rumors she has heard about the Harcos warriors make her wary. It's not long before he wins her over with his patience and gentle tone. The sex scenes in this book involve light bondage, voyeurism, and a light & brief M/F/M episode. I don't normally read books with this type of erotic fantasy but found it palatable. Everything that happens sexually is consensual. The men, while strong and in control in many ways, treat their women with respect and do whatever they have to in order to fulfill their mate's fantasies. Menace and his friend and fellow soldier Vicious (his story was Book 1) obviously love their mates and are very sweet with them at times. I would have been instantly turned off if the men were in any way abusive - luckily that was never the case. This story kept me interested throughout. The only thing that was a little over the top for me was the sex club. I would be interested in reading more books in this series. I am most interested in reading a book about Hazard and Dankirk (even though Dankirk isn't a Harcos warrior).",4

The fact it was about so much more than sex, and how sex was more than just something to enjoy, how it can be used as a weapon to deal with demons deep inside, it was all so emotionally revealing. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the way the author structured her sentences/her flow structure of them, but she more than makes up for it with the way she crafts her erotic scenes that will have you wondering if you should read the book anywhere other than in private.CAUTION: This book is only for those who are open with their sexuality and comfortable discussing subjects that are often considered taboo.",4

I've also been using an older Kindle Touch to create a traveling library that has Kindle books for each age group, and then Kindle books aimed at each individual grandchild, (by interests or just because the hero or heroine has the same name and it's fun to read about somebody who has your name). Anyway, I just never paid attention to joke books until one of the kids started telling me Knock Knock jokes, about half of which he understood and all of which he thought were hysterical.So I thought, ""hey, joke books"". The words are basic and the sentences are simple. The word play can be sort of obvious, but it's still word play and it can sometimes be very clever. Knock Knock and answer and response jokes are actually interactive, since you take turns being the straight man. For a pre-reader or a brand new reader joke books can be the perfect way to have fun with books and words.Here, the jokes are mostly in the ""Question and Answer"" style, e.g. ""What do you call a...?, Why did the ...? Where do you keep a ...?"" That's great because a question builds up excitement for the punchline payoff, and half the time the kid gets the joke and the other half he giggles anyway because the joke is still fun as long as you try to sell it.And these are pretty good jokes, split about evenly between puns, (""Where does a sheep get a haircut? - the Baa Baa shop), and more advanced jokes.So, all in all these particular books strike me as very good examples of the form, and very much worth considering for your little reader. At the least, they should be good for a few nice laughs. Please note that I found this book while browsing Amazon Kindle freebies. I have no connection at all to either the author or the publisher of this book.",4
B00KHAXWX0,A12Q8MINR3GIU6,"05 25, 2014",JustJen,Nice ending to this witchy world.,"Magic abounds in this conclusion of Double Alchemy.  It was so good to see these guys again, and they really seem to have settled into their relationship since we&#8217;ve seen them last.  As with the previous book, there is a lot going on here, both overall and individually.Quinn is still the Grand Poobah of the Warlocks and has a lot to deal with there.  Not only is he still trying to take care of finding and eliminating the Witchfinder General, but there is dissension among the ranks of the Council.  In the search for the Witchfinder General, he is brought back in touch with the Regina of Witches, Valencia, with whom he has a bit of a sordid past.  All of this makes things quite interesting, but then there is also the business of Cade and his Fey issues which are carried over from the previous story.Quinn and Cade have matured quite a bit and even gotten a tiny bit kinkier in their relationship which makes for some hot loving.  Even though their sex lives have kicked up a notch, what with the extra Fey mojo kicking in, most of the heavy stuff is off the page, though you never get a sense you missed anything.  And while the tables have turned a bit here in that Quinn seems the more insecure of the two, there is no doubt they are committed to each other.  Thankfully, Talisen has been a bit more under control and even has a few issues of his own to deal with.I have to say I didn&#8217;t feel quite the same excitement with this one, even though so much happens.  There were some events that sort of came out of nowhere and just didn&#8217;t draw the emotions I expected.  But, there is a lot to love about this interesting world.  The descriptions of the settings and locations are vivid and totally give you a sense of reality.  I loved the added characters, even or especially Valencia, and what they each brought to the story.  As with before, I&#8217;m still a bit intrigued by some, most notably, Talisen, and hope to see more from this world some day.If you&#8217;re looking for a different paranormal filled with lots of magic and action, be sure to give these witches, warlocks and fey a try.Overall Impression:  I really liked it",4

So I was excited when I saw this being listed for publication.Did I love it? I most certainly did!What made this a winner for me was the &#8220;Josh Lanyon&#8221; formula. When Griff first came to the estate, Pierce (the family lawyer) didn&#8217;t exactly welcome him with open arms; Pierce kept questioning Griff&#8217;s motives and he acted briskly around Griff. Sound familiar? If you read so many of Josh Lanyon&#8217;s most notable contemporary romance stories, I am sure it does.However, it was this familiarity that was comfortable for me as a reader. So yes, the relationship took a little while to build &#8211; ALTHOUGH, timeline wise, it actually happened within a week. But it was everything that happened within that week that made it like it wasn&#8217;t instant love.The mystery itself had a &#8216;noir&#8217; feel to it. Maybe it was the fact that Griff came to this huge estate, and he seemed to do more on the research side by asking questions and reading a journal &#8211; instead of using the Internet *lol* &#8212; which made it felt rather &#8216;old and classic&#8217;. I must admit though, I felt quite a jolt of shock when I realized that the kidnapping happened in the early 1990s &#8211; somehow I couldn&#8217;t imagine the 1990s being TWENTY years ago. It didn&#8217;t feel that long for me. Man, I felt old!!Josh offered few clues and red herrings along the way, but I could figure out where he wanted to go with the answer to the mystery of the missing Brian. So while the twist was good, it didn&#8217;t completely surprise me. Still, it was an interesting case and resolution. I wholeheartedly enjoyed it.I did wish that there were more times committed to Griff and Pierce in regard to the romance build-up. Since the story was narrated from Griff&#8217;s perspective, it was easier for me to see the gradual change of feeling. However, I missed Pierce&#8217;s version of the story and his change of heart until that final scene. The ending was also more HFN rather than HEA &#8211; although being familiar with Josh Lanyon&#8217;s stories, it didn&#8217;t really bother me much.All in all, the classic formula worked and I was happy.",4

This was a great sequel to Fate's Design and just like in the first book Defying Fate was filled with plenty of plot twists and surprises.  This book was hard to put down because there was so much action.  I really liked the relationship between Megan and her nephew, Gio.  There were times when he would have creeped me out but if you could overlook those moments then he seemed like such a sweet and adorable kid.  I also liked the scenes with Morgan.  I wasn't the biggest fan of Megan's sister in Fate's Design but I thought she seemed more mature in this book.  My biggest problem with this book was Alex.  In Fate's Design I had grown to really like Alex.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the character he turned out to be.  I wanted so badly not to dislike him but his actions made it nearly impossible to continue to like his character.  There were so many moments in this book where I was on the edge of my seat in anticipation for what would happen next.

If you have not had the pleasure of these short but sassy and sexy reads, you need to start now and get acquainted with the men of this small little town. In previous stories, we have seen a number of women find their place with a man, or in some instances, a few men to make them happy. The Logan family is no exception when it comes to being part of the eye candy that Two Mule contains. While two of the Logan men found their happily ever after already; the youngest of the bunch, Mace, and Jason, have not yet taken their dad up on his challenge to find themselves a wife. The identical twins have had their conquests but never really had eyes for anyone in the long term except one woman: Miss Molly Pritchet, their former English teacher from high school. They know Miss Pritchet has avoided them due to the fact that they were her students, but years have past and they are jail bait no more. With her only being about five years older, they knew things could work if they just made her understand how long they have been waiting to have her as their own. When they finally set their minds to wooing the pretty little school marm, they know she will see that they are all grown and ready to pass any test she is willing to put them through to win her heart.I fell in love with this series when I picked up the very first book. The series is filled with quick reads that offer a number of different situations and combinations that keep things interesting. This one was a particularly fun one for me because I am an English teacher and I know how ackward it can be when a high school boys get flirty and look at you funny. I love that Delilah kept Molly true to her convictions about avoiding students on a personal level. Molly is dedicated to her job and even when she knew the twins were interested she made her best effort to deter their advances. Now that the pair have become men, all bets are off and years have passed so that Molly is able to see Jason and Mace as the gorgeous specimens they have become. Their exploits are flirty, fun and uncomplicated when it comes to showing their feelings to Molly and her reaction to them is nothing less than sweet.While the story is a quickie, it is a fun read. It is not overly in depth but I can understand simply because these men have been previously introduced in other stories. I only wish the more intimate scenes would last longer and be a bit more graphic but overall, I really enjoyed it. Molly is very likeable and not the bombshell type. To me this makes her character more identifiable and the fact that the twins accept and love her, curves and all, makes me enjoy them even more. Fun and fast if you are looking for a quick fix with some cuties that will make you smile.3.75 Stars",4

It was well written and you could really feel the characters. I think the sex could have been left out or just alluded to. It wasn't really necessary to the story and I think given the storyline itself might have gone just a little too smoothly. Otherwise, it's a good read. I guess the happy ending wasn't the one I wanted. I wanted the lose ends tied up. I wanted the bad guy caught and the good guy vindicated in everyone's eyes. While there is no cliffhanger, it just wasn't finished without that for me. Still glad I read it.",4

She left everything behind including her three Keepers, the ones who protect her. Now the past has caught up with her and she will have to face the evil that has been haunting her. She will also come back into contact with her Keepers, one in particular Archer. Archer knows more about Sienna than anyone what he feels is more than protective for her. They are forbidden to love and stand to lose it all if they cross the line. Will they be able to fight the evil and their love or will love be worth the risk.Sienna is a very powerful woman but she really doesn't want anything to do with her powers. She has to learn to use her new powers and soon. She loves her Keepers, family and her friends. She will do whatever it takes to protect them. She also has guilt eating her up on the inside. Archer is strong and very protective. He would do anything to keep Sienna safe from harm. He is also very hard headed and doesn't like to be fussed over.I really enjoyed this book. From the beginning the action starts right away. I was confused a little at first at what was going on but the more you read the more you see what happened in the past to make Sienna and the others the way they are. I liked seeing Sienna working with her powers and learning what she could do. Having not used them she doesn't realize just what she can do. There is several fight scenes that are amazing as well. If your looking for romance you get that with Archer and Sienna. These two have a love that has been going on for years but they can't do anything about it for fear of what will happen and it's against the magic rules. I loved these two together. You also get to see some of the other Archers in this book and I look forward to what they will get into. I will say this book has some sad moments that will shatter your heart so be warned. This is packed full of magic, evil, love, heartbreak, action an more so I would recommend anyone looking for a great story with a magic to pick this up.",4

B00507CYZ2,A44OY8EFDM4IP,"05 28, 2011","Tiffany A. Harkleroad ""Tiffanys Bookshelf""",A nice Medieval mystery,"As the prioress of the priory, Domina Frevisse is required to make many important decisions, decisions which affect the sisters but also the people of the town.  When she is called upon to help rule on a man's guilt or innocence regarding the murder of a townsman, she must look carefully at the entire situation to determine the truth.  Why was with man killed, who would benefit from it, and were things perhaps not as they appeared to be?This was my first exposure to medieval mystery, and I have to say, I was highly intrigued.  It took a little while to get into the story, as the type of language and pacing is a little different than a contemporary mystery novel, but once I adjusted my mindset, I flew through this book.  I was excited to see Domina Frevisse at work, to learn her line of reasoning and type of logic.  I really enjoyed her as a character.  We do not learn much about her personally in this book, but it is not necessary for us to feel a deep connection with her in order to appreciate her character.I really loved the setting of this book, as it was so unique.  Medieval mysteries are a highly specified genre, and the only other author in the genre I am at all familiar with is Michael Jecks, so chances are readers who like his work will also like works by Frazer.  This story is one from a series starring Frevisse, but it also works well as a stand alone book for readers like me just getting acquainted with Frazer's work.It took me a bit to get used to the authors style of writing.  I saw a lot of long complex sentences with several clauses.  Contemporary readers may find this type of sentence a bit more clear had it been broken down into two or three less complex sentences.  It halts the readers pace a bit, having to follow the sentence through multiple clauses and phrases, while continuing the line of thought.  However, once the reader gets further into the book, this becomes less noticeable.  Instead the reader focuses on the rich and entertaining plot.Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and it had helped me open myself up to new genre of books to read.  I am curious about Frazer's other books, and plan to add more of them to my to be read list.",4

She ended up losing 187 lbs in 9 months by using the Atkins Diet that her friends and boyfriend talked her into doing. I have personally weighed close to 160lbs before so losing weight was always my top option. I never tried the Atkins Diet before but as long as you keep your mind on your goal.

B008HYPD58,A2TTHQTPYO88EL,"02 22, 2013",TeresaMaryRose,Great mythology twist!,"I don't think it is a secret that I am a sucker for anything with Greek mythology in it and I take a special liking to the Persephone and Hades myth. So it is really no surprise that I would be drawn to this book. I love a good twist on a great Greek myth and that is exactly what Persephone is.Here is the premise. Imagine Persephone wasn't born back in the time of the Greek gods but in modern day. That is this story and it made for a great one. Persephone has grown up not knowing she is a goddess and naturally this leads to some problems when she finds out. Persephone is the first goddess to come into existence in thousands of years, and this makes her a target. All of this leads to a really great story that weaves in all the important parts of the Persephone myth.We have always been led to believe that Hades is this truly dark, terrifying, and evil guy, but somehow Kaitlin made him appealing. Who knew I could fall head over heels for Hades? But I did. Hades is not simply evil but compassionate and strong and caring as well. Of course he has a dark side and boy does he have a temper, but that is not his only side. Kaitlin took a character that everyone normally fears and twisted him into a dark hero, a swoony dark hero. I loved this take on Hades.The plot in Persephone is at times predictable, but that it to be expected with a book that is retelling a well-known myth. However, there was still a lot about the story that caught me off guard. There are some twists and turns in there that will shock you. This holds true especially with the ending. I was left dying for more of the story and I cannot see where this is going to go next.As I said before, I love Greek mythology and the author did a great job weaving it into the story. With most mythological stories, the gods are hiding and although not everyone believes in them anymore, they have not gone away. But this story, while yes the gods are hiding, not all the myths we have come to know have happened yet. For example, Orpheus makes a cameo during the book. The Greek myths are not a thing of the past that the author is building on; she is literally weaving them into the plot.All in all, Persephone is a really enjoyable read, especially for mythology fans!*I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review",4

B00BJXRMMG,A3RHTYOGSITLWN,"03 4, 2013","K. Branfield ""Book Reviews & More by Kathy""",4.5 star read,"Have you ever read a book that you keep saying, ""One more chapter, and I'll cook dinner?"" or ""One more chapter, and I'll go to bed.""? And dinner is late and you stay up way past your bedtime because one more chapter turns into finishing the book? Well, D.H. Starr's Perfect for Me is that type of book. A compelling and unique plot coupled with wonderful characters who capture your heart make this book impossible to put down and leave you wanting just a little more time with our lead protagonists.In spite of the seriousness of the topics in Perfect for Me, this story is not at all depressing. It is quite hopeful as Mr. Starr dispels some of the myths surrounding an HIV positive diagnosis. With proper medication, safe sex and living a healthy lifestyle, HIV is not a death sentence. For Sean Sullivan, the biggest impact his diagnosis has is on his love life. Always upfront with his potential lovers, his HIV status has ended many relationships before they have had the chance to begun. Sean then decides it would be simpler to date only other HIV positive men, but that decision is immediately challenged when he meets social worker Emery Benton.Despite the many undeniable reasons why Sean and Emery should not date, their sizzling sexual attraction is too strong to ignore. Sean has the most to lose if their relationship does not work out and he quickly puts the brakes on their romance. But Emery has an endless supply of patience and understanding, and they continue to date and get to know one another. But when Sean encounters an unexpected setback, he ends their relationship. But the situation with Lamar keeps pulling the men together and Emery refuses to give up on Sean.The other story arc in Perfect for Me dealing with Lamar and his dysfunctional and abusive family life is heartbreakingly realistic. Lamar's love for and loyalty to his mother leads him to make the wrong decision again and again. Yet neither Sean nor Emery is willing to give up on providing him the opportunity for a better future.If we lived in a perfect world, the children who need the intervention of Child Protective Services would have champions like the characters in Perfect for Me. Emery works tirelessly in his role as a case worker and he remains refreshingly unjaded by the harsh realities of his job. Sean is the type of principal every student should be lucky enough to have. One who sees the promise in a young man's future despite the fact that Lamar's home life is less than ideal. And every child who ends up in foster care should have someone as caring and devoted as Sonya Johnson.I was emotionally invested in all of the characters and storylines in Perfect for Me. None of the various story arcs overpower the novel. Instead each provides depth to the characters and enriches the overall plot. D.H. Starr deftly handles the difficult topic of HIV with sensitivity and he gently educates the reader in a matter of fact manner.A captivating story that should be on everyone's reading list.I received a complimentary copy for review.",4

There are highs and lows as Trey and Sierra work their way through the pain and distrust that surround them. The author did a good job of making this reader care about what happened between Trey and Sierra&#8211;and I really hoped Trey would do a complete 180 and become the man Sierra wanted him to be.

B00D9GXT82,AJROLS3AD3OLL,"06 24, 2013","Because Two Men Are Better Than One! ""NicStar""",Intense gay erotica - rugby and sex!,"Please note that my rating for this book is based on assessing it as gay erotica. It is not a gay romance story.In the author's profile at the end of the book, Patrick Darcy says ""For me, sex should be passionate, intense, sweaty, dirty fun and a no hold barred affair!"". Well that's exactly what he has delivered in this book!The book is told in the first person and opens with Conor preparing himself for a night on the town ""As I wipe away the stream from the bathroom mirror and take a good look at myself, I can't help but think, Conor, you are one hell of a ride."". Conor is in New York for the Gay Rugby World Cup, a tournament which is played every two years.Conor and his roommate Sean meet the rest of the team in the hotel lobby before they all head out to a large gay club nearby for the tournament closing party. I thought the author captured the antics of the players perfectly as they heckle each other and chug their pints in a ritualistic drinking game. There is a real sense of camaraderie.When they reach the club Conor spies Tonio, a player from the San Francisco team, across the floor and he starts remembering the game from earlier that day.Even without understanding rugby, there is a real sense of the game provided in the descriptions and quite cleverly, the on-field manoeuvres are related back to sex. Conor seems to struggle to keep his mind in the game as the pounding of the players translates into what he would like to do off the field.The story reverts back to the club where Conor is prowling for Tonio with whom he had clashed in the game. He has days worth of pent up testosterone and wants Tonio to provide the relief. From here it basically becomes total erotica with a real porn feel. There is not much plot or story. It is just the no holds barred sex, pretty much as the author described himself liking: sweaty, dirty, intense.The author delivers a sex scene that definitely takes the reader right into the moment, describing sights, sounds, smells, feelings. The sex scenes are hot and passionate. The sex is intense. The language is graphic and these boys like it dirty. There is no concept of safe sex.For me, I love a good sex scene, but I just felt the story wasn't resolved adequately for my tastes. I am not exactly sure what I wanted to happen but something just felt a bit flat. Perhaps this is because my personal tastes lean more towards gay romance rather than pure erotica? But if erotica is what you are after then this should definitely hit the mark.Oh, and I will never be using the ice from a hotel ice machine ever again!I received a copy of this book from the publisher, Wilde City Press, in return for an honest review.",4

He felt she'd never forgive the part he'd played in the destruction of her home and her parent's death, and so kept his true feelings to himself. Attracted from the day she'd met him, Agneta fought her love saying nothing, believing he had no deep feelings for her anyway.Caedmon, along with his mother and a party of others fled from the growing hostilities in their area. With his mother's help, he arranged for Agneta and him to be wed and they all left together for his birth home in Normandie. Because he was a Saxon and had deeply buried dislikes for the Normans, he found living there uncomfortable. Pulled apart by his dislike of the people, nevertheless his love for the house and lands inherited from the Saxon who he believed to be his father did make him happy.Until he found out the truth. That he'd been living a lie his whole life. Conflicted, full of fury at life's injustice, he left his home and fled to join the crusades where he found himself fighting alongside the Norman's who he'd always held in such distain. To understand the loyalties involved--those that drove the actions of our hero--it's imperative to accept how deeply ingrained was a man's heritage.The research in this book shone through every page. Many facts about the rivalries, battles and governing royalty were woven into the story...so if you like history, you'll love A Man of Value.",4

New characters are introduced but all your loved (and hated) characters from the first book are back.Andrews continues her unique writing style - I recommend you start with Part One, Extinction Level Event, in this series, but when you ""start"" you'll feel as if you've been slipstreamed right into the middle of a grand plot arc. Andrews likes to reveal bits and pieces of backstory in the middle of character musings - blink and you'll miss some interesting stuff - and there is so, so much still to be told, including how the Redaction began and how humanity will survive the multiple plagues (and whole-country migrations) that follow.With tighter editing, this could really become a classic of post-apocalyptic fiction to rival Stephen King. Andrews still mixes up ""passed"" with ""past"" and she has other homonym errors throughout the book. And the final part of Book Two seems almost farcical in its dealing with true evil. Andrews weaves two main memes through both books - vengeance and forgiveness - and I think she got a bit trite at the end of this book, but I'll forgive her in hopes that Book Three will give her a chance to continue her obvious progression as a writer.There are enough unanswered questions for at many more books in this well-crafted universe, including my personal hope for prequels. Thank you Linda Andrews for your efforts.",4
B0071OU90O,A8KRO8GI5CTP1,"03 30, 2012",Mike,Good Alien Invasion Epic,"A.G. Claymore has crafted a fine alien invasion sci fi story.  Book started out great, introducing main characters with multiple points of view against backdrop of aliens arriving on Mars.  Author does a good job of creating tension on whether aliens are friends or foes before settling the issue.  I did feel that some parts of the story were rushed as the author seemed to have one or two too many balls in the air at once.  Story still flowed well but the terrorist storyline, in particular, seemed to develop slowly then rush to a few spectacular scenes without fully concluding the storyline.There are some minor spoilers in this paragraph but nothing that is more than a few chapters into the book.  Setting is the near future, starting in year 2016, and opens with the aliens arriving at Mars Colony.  Earth mobilizes for hostile aliens while hoping for friendly aliens.  There were many interesting details on societal impacts that arise from cost to mobilize.  It seemed a stretch to me that the UN becomes a powerful central player in this story; while it may be the most logical venue for global coordination, it was a little difficult to accept that UN becomes this effective.  Overall this was a good story which I enjoyed.The Black Ships is a standalone novel albeit with a conclusion which begs for a sequel.  Author's website indicates that a sequel is anticipated this summer (March 27th,2012 reply to a fan comment).  There is also a novella published,Metamorphosis (The Black Ships), in the same universe.No major editing issues were noticed. The Black Ships is 5,574 Kindle locations long. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range. For example, books in Jack Campbell's first Lost Fleet series were approximately 5,000 Kindle locations.",4

Her dreams are her link to the past and to her inner self.I was intrigued by the idea of humans who half of their soul is made up from a bird. The bird part of the soul has the characteristics of different species of birds. It is unique and very interesting.Iris is also an asthmatic. Her asthma limits her physically but she has a spirit who soars, just like the bird in her. She doesn't let her disability control her life. She continues to live and experience new things, even though they could be potentially damaging to her health.This book is short and is told at a fast pace. I enjoyed the pacing. The story moved right along and didn't become dull or boring. There are falshbacks to a past that she doesn't remember. She doesn't remember her childhood or the boy that was a major part of it. They reunite in this book and there is definitely a romantic connection.I really enjoyed this book and it's clean.I received a copy of this book to review.  This is my honest opinion of the book.",4

This book jumps you right into the action.Long story short, Kenric St. James is a master vampire from 1700's England and originator of the group called the Enclave. The Enclave is the group of vampires that protect humans from the bad vampires. Kenric was kidnapped, raped, and turned by a female vampire 300 years prior; once he escaped he vowed to defend humanity and revenge against the one who brutalized him and stole his humanity. Kenric has been alone personally since that time until he runs into nurse Emily who saves him and ends up being is soul mate.Overall, great story and over arching story for the series. I liked the fact that this book showed a male being a victim of a female despite the misconception and stigma that surround those types of situations in our modern society. One aspect of the story I personally did not like was the premise that by dint of nature and general rule, female vampires were weaker than male vampires. I know the author had this premise to support the mating and bonding aspect she goes into, but I didn't care for it. Also at one point, Emily does something I personally found weak and morally reprehensible but Kenric forgives her.However, there are many points and aspects to the story and some interesting characters that as a reader I want to know more about. Arron is one of the characters and I want the story between him and Markus, him and Logan, and him and Elle. Michael is a human helping them and his backstory would be interesting to know as well.",4

Following an array of characters, including the masculine Atego brothers and the beautiful Merrin, EC Hibbs takes us on a journey where self-discovery and self-acceptance is the key to destroy past fears and to accept the pleasures and excitement of the unknown.Blindsighted Wanderer is a gentle, romantic fantasy, suitable for young teenagers and adults alike. It was very easy to get swept away with the dramas and journeys that the characters underwent.  All of the characters that we are introduced to, perhaps with the exception of Adrian, who appears early on in the novel, are highly likeable and have so many realistic traits that it's difficult not to become caught up in their lives and emotions.I was never quite sure how the drama would unfold and was certainly kept in suspense with the relationship developments between characters. This was a particularly enjoyable aspect of the novel, as things did not always pan out in a `traditional' way. These twists and shifts allowed me to remain engaged in the novel.It did take me a while to get caught up in the action after the immediate excitement of the first chapter. This did however allow for a lot of character development. It didn't take too long for the drama to build, so much so that I had my finger poised ready to flip over to the next page.If you are looking for a gentle romance, with strong characters living in a fantasy world, then no doubt Blindsighted Wanderer will be a hit!",4

Mac is trying to process how to handle her mother's hospitalization and diagnosis and Matt is there to help her. It's a this point that Matt started to show the potential of what he could become. He was the perfect support and shoulder to cry on. He was kind and softer and a good listener and a good partner. Mac needed him and we needed to see him step up and show us something other than the sexy, controlling beast he'd previously been. It was nice to see his character develop more. Court: It really was. I had high hopes for what might happen after this. But I should have KNOWN it was too good to be true. If it seems too good, it probably freaking is. When will I ever learn? WHEN, SHEL, WHEN! *dramatic sigh*Shel: Then, Mac returns to work and once again Matt pissed me off. I mean...COME ON MATT!!!! It's time to grow up.

I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoying this. I like the way this story line changed and developed.One thing the author did that bothered me though, this is told in first person but a few times remarks were made to foreshadow that didn&#8217;t flow from third person. Example was a sentence that went something like, I should have seen the look that passed between the two but I did not. Maybe I am being particular, but this happened three times and it irked me. Maybe you as a reader won&#8217;t be bothered at all by this. It could just be my taste, it just felt wrong.Anyways, besides me being a book snob, there was a lot about this that really works for me. Brooke is our lead. She is British and tends to have an attitude that is very self-assured. I like that!

However, while there are many means of achieving health and happiness, sometimes people tend to be afraid of those different ways and methods and do not know where to start in entirety when it comes to becoming more healthy and starting to learn new much healthier habits and tricks in life that will lead to a healthier lifetime and better results. Generally speaking though, there is no reason to be afraid of trying to follow the different types of strategies made especially for people to be able to achieve healthier and better results when they are trying to aim for that and accomplish something like that. However, exactly which kinds of healthy strategies out of all the different recommended by various experts ones that exist today are the best to try out and make work for a certain person? Well, of course that would most likely depend upon the person him or herself along with their personality and their various kinds of individual preferences as well as ideas. But side that which ones are actually potentially effective in helping a person achieve health and which ones are actually proven to work well? Which ones are actually worth giving a try when someone is trying to achieve health and fitness and perhaps possibly lose or at the very least simply maintain a certain weight? Well, the thing is, there are truly many good ones that do actually work. For instance, one of those strategies for health improvement happens to be the gluten free diet, which has many different characteristics that can help a certain person achieve his or her health as well as fitness goals, no matter what they happen to be in actuality. How does the gluten free diet do that and what exactly does it entail? What are some of a gluten free diet's main characteristics, in other words? Well, of course, as =any other thing in existence in the world today, gluten free diets are numerous and exist in many different forms, ways and shapes. They are all different, but all include one major similarity, which what most importantly makes this diet so healthy and helpful. That happens to be the exclusion of unhealthy carbs from the diet of a certain person, no matter who he or she happens to be. This in turn helps cleanse and further purify the body, allowing more healthy factors to come in to play with better nutrition and less unbeneficial consumptions throughout the day.",4

He&#8217;s not very happy about this and does not want her starring in his film. He thinks she will ruin the film with her drinking and drugging, and he doesn&#8217;t want to babysit a beautiful but spoiled teenager. Too bad the decision has already been made and there is absolutely nothing he can do to change it.Jake also has his own problems &#8211; he is a sex addict and trying his hardest not to let his little head take over his life anymore. The big problem is, he&#8217;s been ordered to have beautiful and sexy Star stay at his house until the filming is over.Jake and Star are definitely attracted to each other. Can Jake keep his dick in his pants? Can Star stay clean and sober? Will this movie end up being a hit? Or will it flop? I can tell you this: I&#8217;ll be waiting to find out when the next book in this series, Falling Star, is released, hopefully near the end of July.Overall, Arianne Richmonde sure knows how to write stories that CAPTURE my attention fully. Her characters are all well thought out and they have very interesting back stories. Arianne also adds in some VERY SENSUAL scenes that always get me all heated up while reading. This is a continuing series and Shooting Star does not end with a big cliffhanger. It&#8217;s a short installment of around 64 pages and sets this story up PERFECTLY!I HIGHLY recommend any of Arianne Richmonde&#8217;s books. She is a FANTASTIC author. So, if you have not read any of her books, grab one, read it, and find out for yourselves just why I&#8217;m such a HUGE FAN!",4

They are either exceedingly dense betraying a need to justify the premise or are carelessly assembled stretching all credibility. Nuttall's tale of Britain once again single-handily facing off with the Nazis is neither. It is a highly entertaining tale that imagines Hitler invading the UK a few years after a different Second World War. The author employs Student, Skorzeny, Monty, Rommel, Liddell Hart, Himmler, Truman and even Kim Philby in this new conflict.The action moves from the trenches to the war rooms with ease and the battles are highly engaging. I do not normally enjoy sea or air warfare stories but they were very well done as were the tank and infantry set-tos. One minor complaint was some of the language. I could not imagine Otto Skorzeny saying, &#34;They're going to be moving units around like crazy&#34; or a German tanker commanding, &#34;Call up air support and paste those guns.&#34; Both sound too contemporary and American. All can be excused if not taken too seriously and, if so, one will find comic book-like enjoyment in the pages.",4

All of that comes crashing down, however, when she walks in on her fianc&eacute; cheating on her. Hurt and embarrassed beyond belief, she quickly leaves town and finds herself in Lake Jackson, Texas &#8211; a place that will take her completely by surprise.Parker is someone who never has to want for anything. He has the money to do what he wants, when he wants, but even that is not enough to make him happy. Often bitter and angry, no one can really make him feel &#8211; until he sees her. He is drawn to Willow and he&#8217;s not sure why. Confused, he often lashes out at her, pushing her away. Will the two be able to find common ground together, or will their differences be enough to drive a permanent wedge between them?Willow was a sweet girl that drove me batty at times. She spent a lot of time in her head and that made me feel a bit disconnected occasionally as it seemed to slow down the pacing of the story.Parker was a bit more complex. This novel is a part of a series and this was Willow&#8217;s story. I&#8217;m curious to see where Parker&#8217;s story is taken next as I want more of a look into the easily angered, emotionally scarred character that I saw here. There were times that I wanted to reach into the story and smack him for some of the things that he did and said, but then there were times that I just wanted to hug him. Hey, I&#8217;m allowed to change my mind.The side characters were some of my favorites, especially Angel, Riley and Tanner&#8217;s daughter. She was just plain adorable and there&#8217;s a scene in which she finger paints with her ice cream in a place that she really shouldn&#8217;t. It brought a smile to my face.

B00H0NPS16,A29RJIOV1SDH0,"03 9, 2014",AlyseGarner,Engaging and Enjoyable,"A short story from a woman whose heart and heritage lie in the subcontinent of India Rapid Fall is not just another romantic novella; with it&#8217;s characters and roots anchored firmly in the traditional ideals of Eastern cultures this is an exploration of personal belief and social morals, pitting modern expectations against long held principles without distracting from an engaging character driven narrative.The first solo work from author Adiana Ray Rapid Fall is packed full of adjectives about love and synonyms or metaphors for lust, Ray has ensured that the message here, that the lead characters Sonia and JD are undeniably infatuated with and extremely attracted to one another, is well and truly driven home.This is, obviously, an important aspect of the storyline and without it the personal struggle that Sonia experiences would not be such an uncertain and emotional one; but after a while one does begin to feel a little like a well flogged dead horse and Ray just spends the tiniest bit too long on establishing the on-off and sexually tense relationship between her characters.Once established however she quickly moves on to the more interesting part of the story, where the expectations of Sonia&#8217;s own beliefs and the traditional culture in which she grew up are shaken violently by the sheer strength of her love and desire. I don&#8217;t want to spoil the story for any potential readers but I will say that the ultimate outcome of Sonia&#8217;s inner struggle is overshadowed by the journey she must take to come to that conclusion.Overall an engaging and enjoyable piece, if not a little over wordy and clich&eacute; in some areas.",4

In the later years of the Sixties, the `Big Three' (Beatles, Stones and Dylan) had given up touring.  However, by 1969, the Rolling Stones were ready to go back on the road and Lydon accompanied them on tour.This, then, is the story of a US tour, which culminated in the stabbing of an eighteen year old fan, Meredith Hunter, in Altamont - murdered by Hells Angels.  The whole tour reads like an unorganised and disjointed affair; cars don't turn up, equipment is delivered to the wrong places and there are often unexplained delays.  The Stones houses are described as a sort of `temporary Versailles', full of supplicants.  Meanwhile, those around the band both resent the fame of the Stones and are yet tarnished by being out of the inner sanctum.  ""We all seemed beyond the law,"" muses the author, of those days of drugs, politics and endless music festivals - when the Sixties came to a close in violence and upheaval.  This is a fascinating account of the end of an era and perhaps partially explains why music festivals gave way to the big business stadium rock shows of the Seventies.",4

This book is sooo full of heart-wrenching emotions and flawed characters, with demons of the present and ghosts of the past to face.It took some time for me get into the story- after reading the prologue and first two chapters, I was almost sure that I had made a mistake in trying to read this book. Well, I'm really glad I continued reading it!The female lead is Aysa. I was seriously shocked about Aysa's character- I really hope there is no one in the real world out there like her. Aysa is not your average heroine- most people do not even see her, and act as if she does not exist. If they do see her, they end up either making fun of her in some way, or using her for their own ends and not even thanking her for it.Ezra is a twenty to year old male, who keeps running from the mistakes of his past. His past and his actions there define his present in every way. The story revolves around these two. Will they both save each other, or will they pull each other down into the abyss?The character development was very good. Lila Felix slowly builds the characters- so subtly that before I knew what was happening, I was so invested in the characters that I was unable to stop reading the book , wanting to know what happens next. Even though I was sure I would not like the bevy of emotions this book churned in me.And, Is that HEA by the end of that book? NO. Instead, this book leaves us with a cliffhanger. Now I'll just have to wait for the second book Doves for Sale, and hope for a HEA there at least!Also, the cover is quite beautiful.I received an ARC of this book from the author for an honest review.",4

This book begins in the airport, while Kayla is waiting to board a plane to go to her younger sister's wedding.  Kayla is not looking forward to the trip, because she know's her parents will be constantly harassing her about having a boyfriend.  Kayla has it all thought out.  She has a made up boyfriend, but no one she can take on the trip with her.  To top it off, she has a fear of flying, so she is going stir crazy while waiting to board the plane.

So, when he finds out she has a first class ticket, he goes to the counter and trades in his coach seat so he can be in the seat next to her to help her through her fear.  Kayla is a self-reliant woman who knows what she wants, and also knows that she doesn't need a man to help complete her.  Cooper is an ex-marine with his own baggage, and they are both commit-a-phobics.  Before you know it, Cooper has Kayla thinking of other things...way hotter things...than flying.  She gets drunk on the plane and all her insecurities are forgotten with one kiss from this sexy-swoon worthy ex-marine.  He lays the charm on thick and before you know it, they decide that he will act as her boyfriend for the weekend.  What could go wrong, right?!  They both are all in for this short wild ride, and I do mean ride ladies...of a lifetime.Cooper has convinced himself that he doesn't need anyone in his life and he has a lot of guilt over the war. He thinks he is damaged goods.  He has a soft spot for people in trouble, and Kayla has him whirling. Cooper helps Kayla lose all her inhibitions and the two of them have some earth shattering, mind blowing, up close and personal sexcapades in very public places!!!  Cooper was sensual, hot, mesmerizing, tantalizing, and oozing sex appeal in every way possible!  This was a fast paced, quick read novella, full of excitement, and the thrills kept coming.

That comment is relevant to this book until the last chapters.I liked the book (that's what 4 stars means) but didn't love it.

Ones she&#8217;s not sure are a good idea. Ones she&#8217;s familiar with. And even though she knows there is the possibility that he will burn her&#8230; again, she accepts the terms and decides to go along with his little game.Willow has something Nick wants. And it&#8217;s pretty simple&#8230; her. All of her. And he&#8217;s determined to make her see that he&#8217;s the man she belongs with.Now don&#8217;t all good love stories begin with a little blackmail? Just kidding, Nick is so sweet that I don&#8217;t really think he knows the right way of going after a women that he actually wants, and one that he&#8217;s willing to keep forever. So he does it the only way he knows how, and in some ways he actually made it work. I kind of felt sorry for the poor sap at times though. He seemed to get conflicting advice from his friends. It&#8217;s a good thing he stuck with it and eventually got what he wanted.Now as much as Willow and her insecure, poor me attitude made me want to shake the ever living sh!t out of her, Nick&#8217;s swoony, smooth talking, football-stud-hunkiness, with just the right amount of alpha male, totally made the story and kept me wanting more from him. And to tell you the truth, I would still like some more of him! Now, I wasn&#8217;t always hating on Willow. She was strong willed; determine to succeed without any help from her sometimes overbearing rich daddy. Yes, she was wronged by Nick in the past, but she really doesn&#8217;t know the truth why he left her behind the first time. No one can really fault a young up-and-coming football player for doing what he did either, he made the right decision for him, at the time.I would have liked to replace Willow in the book with someone more like myself. Who&#8217;d be at his mercy day and night. On second thought&#8230; that story would have only been about lots of hot steamy sex, with no actual plot, and who wants to read that? Not I! That&#8217;s right, leave the story line to the professionals. I guess on that thought, Willow does add some feistiness and boldness to the story. I suppose she wasn&#8217;t all that bad, she was just protecting her heart, and I sort of get that. And kudos to her for being able to resist Nick as long as she did. If Nick loves her and momma Hamilton loves her, then I guess I can too. Just as long as she makes him happy.I also love that Karen still gave us glimpses of Jared and Sheridan from the first book in the series, Game for Marriage, I&#8217;ve seriously missed those two.Karen never fails to give us the steamy sex and I especially liked the restaurant roof top at the Wharf. And Willow definitely had me laughing at her silly little leg routine, you&#8217;ll need to read it to find out what I mean. I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy the story as much as I did, and now it starts all over again, with the long wait for the next book in the series.flag",4

He was rough around the edges, but there was something solid and real about him that part of her found oddly soothing&#8230;&#34;Guardian for Hire is the second book in the For Hire series by Christine Bell. I haven't read the first book and didn't have a problem jumping right into this one. However, the first and second books are connected and have stories that build on each other. If you&#8217;re like me and like to read series in chronological order, I&#8217;d recommend reading Wife for Hire first. It will provide the backstory for Guardian for Hire.Sarabeth Lucking thought she had her dream job working as a therapist  at a posh couples resort.  Unfortunately, her dream turns into a nightmare when the resort owners turn out to be involved in an elaborate blackmailing scheme and she is left without a job and less than stellar referencs. Things get even worse, when her former co-workers starting showing up dead. Her close friends encourage Sarabeth to take precautions to ensure her safety and send Gavin McClintock to protect her. Unfortunately, Sarabeth doesn&#8217;t think she&#8217;s in danger and is less than thrilled about accepting any help from Gavin until someone tries to kill her...Sarabeth was a difficult character to like initially. She came across as spoiled, ungrateful, and at times, rude. In the beginning she definitely had a couple TSTL moments but after realizing the threat against her is real, she finally comes around. Her character definitely evolves as the story progresses and she made me laugh more than once with her different antics.Gavin McClintock is not a man you want to mess with. As a security expert, he&#8217;s used to giving directions and having them followed. He&#8217;s sexy, capable, and definitely has some alpha tendencies. He&#8217;s also committed to protecting Sarabeth from the bad guy.Although Sarabeth and Gavin get off to a rough start, an attraction develops between them and both find it hard to resist despite their differences. The book was steamy, pretty much what I&#8217;d expect from an Entangled Indulgence title.&#8220;I think I know a way I can make you feel better,&#8221; he breathed. Her back arched into him, her core pressing against his hot, hard bulge. With deft movements, he released her wrists and tore open the shirt she&#8217;d been wearing, sending buttons flying in every direction.Her breath caught in her throat as he closed his mouth over her pert nipple, sucking on the sensitive tip until her toes curled and her thighs quaked. &#8220;Gavin&#8230;&#8221;&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to feel better?&#8221; he asked, raising a hand to stroke her other tight peak.&#8220;I&#8230;&#8221; she started, and he got on his knees, reaching to massage both her breasts, and his mouth travelled lower, uninhibited by her lack of panties.His tongue flicked against her bud, and he looked at her, his chin resting against the light trail of hair that led to her center. &#8220;Yes?&#8221; he asked, his hands gripping her waist.&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered&#8230;Yeah, Gavin was an easy character to like =)Overall, there's wasn't anything terribly original about the plot but it was still an enjoyable read and had everything I like in a romance. It was well written, had a sexy hero, and a nice level of steam.  I'd recommend for readers that are looking for a quick read with a touch of suspense. A solid 3.5 READ.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",4
B00HG4U4O0,A1Q1PDU91ND28H,"05 7, 2014","Bj Cox ""tigermom""",Blast from the Past,"This book reads like a Jackie Collins book from the 70's mixed with a clipped British delivery.  It is also surprisingly easy to read.  The mixture of people behaving badly and lots of plot devices with a very dry British delivery makes an enjoyable tale of Lucy.  At 28 her career is stalled and Laurent, her lover with the roving eye, is looking for a reason to ditch her and make a more upwardly mobile match with a woman he cannot stand.  She has excellent social climbing and political connections, but he really does not like her.  Lucy leaves France and faces a delayed flight.  She lets out an expletive in French and is invited by an amused Marcus Delacroix to join him in the first class lounge.  Lucy is easy going, innocently honest and is considered by most people who know her as not ambitious.  Marcus is in his fifties and was married at 33 to woman 18 years older than he and was happily married with no scandal.  His wife has been dead for two years and at 52 he has decided he would like to have a son and thinks an arranged marriage to someone who is honest and easy going would fit his needs nicely so he investigates Lucy and offers her marriage.  Lucy has a wonderful grandmother, a stodgy mother who attended University with Marcus, and a father who is starting on his fourth wife and invites the previous three to the party.  He calls them ACE:  Amelia, Cathrine and Ellen.  Amelia is a lawyer, Cathrine, an investigative journalist and Emma a supermodel.  These unique woman stay in Lucy's life and are part of the rich characters that make this book special.  Saule, the driver, bodyguard and keeper of Marcus's secrets heads up a supporting cast of characters that includes the Prime Minister and the Foreign Office secretary and his wife, Cherry Red a high priced madam and a rather obnoxious Siamese cat help round out the cast of funny characters.Marcus is about to be knighted and lots of people are gunning for him and Lucy is collateral damage.  There is a lot Lucy does not know and you are torn as a reader between thinking she ought to know and hoping she never learns.  Lucy does not know what she feels, but knows she is feeling more for Marcus than she ought to in her situation.  Once you get used to the dry delivery, this book is a page turner.",4

B00J98RD4A,A3PBD5LUY1F529,"04 26, 2014",K. Holt,3.5 stars,"MAIL ORDER MISFIT (BRIDES OF BECKHAM) by Kirsten Osborne runs 89 pages (minus front- and end-matter).  This novella blends themes of coming of age, self-discovery, self-esteem, finding strength within oneself, growing love between a couple married for convenience.Elaine takes a big risk in choosing a mail order bride escape-route from her home in Beckham, Massachusetts.  It's a believable reason to want to find her own way forward, as a childhood injury left her with a limp (see book description).  I enjoyed discovering the villain in this story and how that individual's choices affected the story's plot and development.  It was good to see this novella have *something* lurking out there and threatening the newlyweds' happiness.  Outside of the villain, the story was light on conflict and much of Elaine's baggage that frankly could've been wrapped up very quickly.  The villain's impact was minor and did conclude rapidly.Through much of this novella, there's not a lot happening.  Many of the scenes illustrate Elaine and Colin coming to love each other, and Elaine's self esteem solidifying, but they're so full of &#34;fluff&#34; that this could've been a short story instead.  The book is riddled with a significant number of typos (dropped letters: 'h' instead of 'he', misused/misspelled words: 'table clothes' instead of 'table cloths', incorrect statements: 'over the years'...but it was only 2 or 3 months later.)...one more read through by another set of eyes would've saved Ms. Osborne the embarrassment.  I'm still thrown off by the constant switches in point of view from character to character (often every other paragraph)....but I guess that's this writer's style.....Sensuality Level: moderately spicyLanguage: PGA light, easy read.  My rating is solidly between &#34;It's OK&#34; and &#34;Liked It&#34;--",4

A bit of steampunk, a bit of magic, some very special children, a bit of steamy romance and a very likable leading lady. And while I enjoyed the book, most of these good bits were under-utilized. I just wanted to see more of everything Pape set up, more of the Knights of the round table (hereditary mage-ish gentlemen who secretly protect England from predation by evil vampires) and more of the ragtag bunch of also magical children.But I did like the story well enough that I will be checking out the next one (which I was lucky enough to snag a free kindle preorder) and hoping that with her next sojourn to this world inPhotographs & Phantoms, Pape delves a bit deeper into all the good stuff in that world - there is such potential.",4

Chambers,Amazon's own 5V charger for Kindles,"This is the official AC wall charger that Amazon now recommends for the Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Fire HD 7"", Kindle Fire, Kindle Touch, Kindle Keyboard, and Kindle DX. It does not include a USB charging cable, but every Kindle to date has included a cable (USB Type A to Micro USB). (Many tablets and cell phones also use the same type of cable.) The output for the adapter is 5V~1.0A. Amazon states that this adapter will fully charge a Kindle Paperwhite in less than 5 hours.It's a good charger, well matched with the Paperwhite and other Kindles and Kindle Fires. A few years ago, I bought some extra Amazon AC chargers (Amazon 5W USB Charger) for the nieces and nephews when my wife and I upgraded and gave them our old Kindles. These older-model chargers have been very reliable, but their output is 5V~0.85A, so it would take longer to recharge a Kindle with one. Since I've seen special deals on the older-model charger recently, my guess is that Amazon will be phasing them out soon and going with the new charger that was just released.The charger itself is compact, very solidly made, and the folding prongs are a nice touch that makes it easier to pack the charger without poking holes in things. There are many other third party 5-volt power adapters on the market, but if you want the confidence of buying a genuine Amazon product, this is the charger you want. Alternatively, if you already have a DC 5V charger with an output current around 1 Amp, you can use it. It's your choice.",4

B00GGXXQCO,AMX01ZPHJS30Q,"04 16, 2014",Amazon Customer,Cassie Shine is making her mark with this debut novel.,"I received a review copy of this title in exchange for my honest review. Thoughts and opinions are my own.Cassie Shine is making her mark with her debut novel Harp's Song. It is both gripping and emotional. Harp's Song tackles some tough topics like abuse, neglect, and intimidation. Her storytelling is engaging and kept me turning page after page until the very end.The relationship between Harp and her mother was really tough to read. There were just a few moments of direct interaction between them and they were filled with so much pain and fear. It was understandable that Harp avoided her mother and spent a lot of time away from home as possible to avoid the mental and physical abuse.But Harp was lucky enough to have people around her that cared about her and her well being. She had people to turn when she it got really bad with her mom. There was another adult stepping in to fulfill the caretaker role that Harp's mom never accepted. This was something that I really liked about the story. Harp didn't keep all of her secrets hidden. She opened up to her best friend and his mom and accepted the help that they willingly gave her. She didn't have to figure it all out on her own.I loved the reading about the friendship between Harp and Connor. Whether their relationship was platonic or romantic, it felt authentic. Their interactions made me smile quite a few times. It was easy to believe that they truly were best friends.The story does have a resolve and doesn't end with a cliffhanger, but a follow-up book is in the works. I've already added the next to my book to my reading wish list. Cassie Shine and her characters have made an impression on me and I want to see what happens next - between Harp and her mom and between Harp and Connor.",4

That is the opening David has been waiting for to start his assault on Jenna. He acts like a Barbarian at the gate as he ruthlessly bags and tags her into marriage. His proposal is simple, marry him for 2yrs and help him secure the Presidency of his company by acting as his faithful wife to receive  $200,000.

David has had a major hard on for Jenna ever since he clamped eyes on her and the moment he gets his hands on her his Alpha kicks into overdrive and the deal is out the window.

I think that's a good method; it's pretty well known now that temporary diets do not work for long.Each tip is accompanied by a specific ""Action Plan.""  I really liked that idea; what good does it do to learn about a new habit, but don't take any action?Here are my favorite tips from this little book:tip 1: Become a binge drinker of water.tip 3: Take a daily fish oiltip 4: Track your calories (I use the app, ""Lose-it,"" which I believe is the #1 calorie/fitness tracker.)tip 8: Eat slowly. The author points out that the brain takes 20 minutes before it registers how much you've eaten.tip 13: Spice it up with capsaicin (from hot peppers).tip 17: Start exceedingly small. Another excellent idea--set small goals at first, to get some momentum going.tip 21: Try almond milk.  I had no idea that there are only 30 calories in a cup of almond milk.  After seeing this tip, I ran out to the fridge and checked--by golly, he's right--only 30 calories!I liked the fact that all the tips were listed right up front in the Table of Contents.

Behind all of the really dark and difficult content of this book, there is a story of a girl coming out of her shell to stand up for herself and the boy she falls for. The characters are well written and the story line is engaging and well laid out.Kristen and Chris are so perfect for each other. Kristen is trying to deal with her home life day by day. Even though there were several times I wanted to yell at her to move out I also understood her perspective of the situation. It was like she was manipulated and didn&#8217;t realize it until she met Mila and Chris. However, she is one strong and smart person to deal with her life and adapt. Chris has had a LOT of similar things happen to him but he has a little brother to keep safe as well. I really admired his perseverance and his devotion to his brother. They were people to me and not just characters. Mila also had a great support role to this story as a secondary character.I enjoyed the characters as well as the romance in this story. I struggled to read about what Kristen had to go through but it gave the book an edge and made it more realistic. This was a really good book and I think it deserves a 4 out of 5 stars!",4

Rhonda Gilreath covers all the basics about where to get coupons, where to use them and when and how to shop for the best deals. The basic advice here is great.A couple of caveats:1. Not all of the things that Gilreath does herself can anyone do. Many stores, for example will allow you to use a store coupon and a manufacturer's coupon on the same product - a part of what she calls &#34;coupon stacking&#34;. This is a legal, valid practice in most states/chains. In others, it is not.2. Another portion of what she calls &#34;coupon stacking&#34; varies from chain to chain and that's using identical coupons for the same products. It appears that she can shop where she is never limited in how many of a product she can buy with an identical coupon. In my area, one of the biggest chains with the best deals, limits you to 4 identical coupons. So, if you get inserts from 10 Sunday papers from the same week and cut out 10 identical coupons, you can only use 4 in a single trip to the store. You'll need to make multiple trips/transactions to use all 10.3. Stores in MANY areas DON'T pay back the overage from coupons as cash as she states but most also DON'T apply it to the balance of your bill to discount non coupon items. That's a rare practice. Ask at your store how they handle the overage when the final price, after coupon. would actually put money in your pocket.4. Finally, Triple coupons are nice but it's a very rare occurrence that most major chains DON'T practice except on very rare occasions. Too, when they do this, they don't normally triple coupons up to $1.00 as she states. If they normally only double coupons up to $.99, it's typical that on a triple coupon day or 3 day period, they only triple coupons up to $.50 cents. That's not quite the savings she touts with her coupons that become worth $3.00 each.",4

At the same time, he is actually somewhat weak, allowing his ex-girlfriend and a couple of one night stands walk all over hum. This might be because of his innate desire to please them, nit make waves, not hurt them, but, by doing this he just hurts them and himself.The book is well written but, if a considerable amount of cursing and a lot of drinking offends you, this book is not for you. The author is British and every word and action in this novel is intensely British.Now, the ending: it is poetic.

Her past has changed the once happy go lucky, energetic, free spirited girl she once was to the closed off, shy, empty girl she is now.  Living her life day to day trying to keep her past in the past has taken its toll and all that changed when her eyes landed on one Parker Porter.Parker Porter has never been shy about what he wants and he goes after it with everything he has.  When he laid eyes on Grace he knew that no matter what he was suppose to do he couldn't stop his body from craving her touch.  He needed her like he needed his next breath and going against everything he knew was right he went after her and he wouldn't stop until he knew what she felt like pressed up against him.When Grace's past starts to unravel in front of her eyes it takes everything in her not to lose all the sanity she has left.

What happens when something from your past has already crossed paths with your future? Is Grace and Parkers connection strong enough to overcome the lies and betrayal?Nacole brought us a beautiful story about 1 girl who was put through hell and back and still managed to come out in one piece.  Grace is a strong and beautiful character that endured things nobody should have to endure.  She was lied to and betrayed so many times that I wondered how she wasn't more of a mess than what she currently was.They say to be careful of the quiet ones.  A statement I never truly understood, to be honest.  What is wrong with being quiet or a little on the shy side?  It's a demeanor I use as a mask to hide myself from a world I don't feel like I fit into.  In one false move, the life I've so carefully constructed could crumble, leaving me vulnerable and exposed. - A Graceful MessWhen Grace and Parker first meet there is something between them that pulls them towards each other.  Something about Parker that lights a fire deep within her soul and slowly she starts to find the girl she once was.  She holds onto that dearly even though a part of her is scared of having her heart broken again.  She has trouble with trusting people because of her past but Parker is determined to break those walls down that Grace has built and make her his.The reflection of the girl staring back at me has a glimmer in her eye, one I don't recall ever noticing.

You know you're home alone but you hear a strange sound from a different room or you come back and things just feel like they're out of place? Well that's sort of what Camryn's going through when she moves into her brand new apartment. She's the only one that lives there. The only other people are the staff who seems nice enough but no one lives in the apartment building but her. Except someone is moving around upstairs.This story is about that terrifying time when you might think that you're not alone. Camryn thought that she was alone. After all, she's the only one in the building. But she doesn't feel like she's alone. When she hears noises at night she could swear they're coming from an unoccupied apartment. But the noises don't stop and she knows that something's wrong. It's enough to give anyone chills while you read. You definitely won't want to be reading this book while you think you're alone in your own house because it will terrify you right out of your wits.You'll be able to relate to the terror and emotion that Camryn feels as she tries to go about her normal life. She doesn't know what else to do after all since the staff at her apartment insist that everything is fine and she shouldn't worry. And she doesn't want to be a wimp and call someone to stay with her or leave the apartment. She wants to stay and she wants to do it alone. She's already missing her ex and she doesn't want to make things worse for herself. So she sticks it out.If you're the type of person that loves edge-of-your-seat thrillers with some hot and sexy romance thrown in then this is definitely for you. Camryn and her mystery guest will keep you at the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. And of course everyone wants to know why the staff things everything is fine and there's a stranger living in an apartment upstairs without being officially 'there'. Is he a serial killer? That's what Camryn is starting to think and she's worried about being the next one on his list. But is that really the case?I would recommend this book to a lot of my friends and family. I have some family that has never really been that interested in romance before but this book is mostly about the terrifying scenes where Camryn is freaking out about the person who is living upstairs. There are plenty of sex scenes of course that will have you hot all over. But this book is meant to invoke fear.",4

In Unbeloved, we travel with Dorothy on her journey, both present and past, with the men she loved - Jase and Hawk. One she says goodbye to, and the other she finally admits her love for after letting go of her fear.We meet Christopher, Dorothy and Hawk's son. Deuce is present, only he's a little more laid back and reserved. Cox and Kami are still fighting, as are Cage and Tegen. Everyone is older and time has passed. It's a good book, just a lot different. There's a side story with the Russian mafia, which we learn Hawk is related to. And ZZ is there and worse than ever. We actually get a little preview of what's to come in a future book and it looks like ZZ is really about to sign his death warrant.

When I first got into it I could not believe how good it was and how it grabbed my attention. As a reader I want the author to grab my attention and really get me motivated to read more of their story. This book does that and more. I could not put it down. The reason for only 4 stars it has a few grammatical errors but that does not take from the story at all.This is the story of Jack Dalton and Holliday Huges. Holliday is a woman who started her own company off of something that she thought was funny one night. She never thought it would go anywhere and never thought it would be a big as it is. Holliday goes to a conference in Vegas where at the bar the first night there she meets Jack Dalton who she thinks is a security guy for the hotel. I won't ruin the surprise of who he is but the sparks are instantaneous between these two. Holli doesn't do one night stands and Jack knows he is keeping secrets but also knows he has to have Holli.This is a roller coaster ride of a relationship that you can't count the number of time there needs to be another chance given to it.

Eva needs to have be forward or the book doesn't work. And I love the interactions and verbal play between Eva and Alexander. I feel like the writer is trying to fit into this genre because of the explotion of 50 Shades, Crossfire, and Blackstone... but I think the writer could have fit in with books like ""On Dublin Street"" and still achieve what they are going for.Overall it was well worth the time and look forward to seeing where Eva and Alex go or don't go... it shall be revealed in time.I was not paid to write this review but was given an advance reader copy.",4

I don't like people who hid children from another parent, however...the reasons for it being done in this book, is because the father had stated quite simply even before their marriage ended, that he never wanted children-ever.So rather than tell him and make his life miserable, she just went on  with her life alone with her child. Then after he'd made a boat load of money, she was afraid he'd sue for custody because of the way their marriage had ended.

His brother Sheldon Truman was victimized by Warner gold-digging-fake pregnant Texan fianc&eacute;, Rielle.  Warner has forgiven Sheldon and even tried to give him a job, but that is not Sheldon's thing.Taddy also has an assistant who is colorful in her own right.  Kiki is a virgin Mormon who moved to NYC from Provo, Utah.  Kiki plays a small but important role in this book.Taddy first runs into Warner at his hotel in St. Barths.  She thinks he is her huge crush -- a famous football player -- and is surprised to discover he is in fact someone else.  Their first encounter runs afoul when Rielle shows up.Warner spends the next five months pining for Taddy, whose identity he does not know.  Taddy thinks that he is married and tries to set him our of her mind.  The two reunite in Cannes and it is brilliant, but it did take a long time to get there.In some ways, this book is very explicit.  And there is a very graphic back door action.

He's daring and adventurous, but is guarded and confused by his own emotions. The topic of marriage and kids seems to be a topic that comes up often enough throughout the story, and Finn has some very serious reservations about the two. While I get Hadley's view, I found myself getting irritated by her. It's like having a friend who wants a certain guy, but wants to change huge aspects of him. Why not find someone who suits you better instead of fighting with someone to change their perspectives?Just as with any relationship. especially ones in the world of romance novels, their relationship goes through some ups and downs. I enjoyed the little glimpses into Finn's perspective and when things are good with Finn and Hadley, or as he refers to as &#34;Becks&#34;, things are really good.If you are looking for an easy read, that has hot, steamy scenes and isn't an emotional ride, then this is a good place to start!",4

They previously met when Sasha was acting as an assassin for Nero , a secret organisation that's trying to build its own army of  super soldiers. Sasha had been lied to and told she could obtain an antidote to her condition if she played along and captured Arens sister in law. Needless to say that didn't go down well and now Sasha is on the run from both Nero operatives and the Werewolves.Unfortunately for Aren when they met he realised that fate is a twisted bitch and has made Sasha his mate and he's left  tracking her down .  Sasha is on the run but Nero have sent a rogue werewolf after her and he's getting too close for comfort. Realising that her baby sister is in danger she turns to the strongest and most honourable male she knows, Aren. Sasha finds the guy insanely attractive but how can he or his pack ever forgive her for her previous actions.? Aren asks his brother to hide Nadya , Sasha's younger sister and reluctantly Adam agrees. Sasha never asked to be a shifter but her police experience makes her a sharp lady who's capable of taking care of herself but this time she knows she's out of her depth.

Will Sasha ever look at him and realise his feelings are true? They will have to survive in order to find out!This was an easy and very interesting read.

The young couple shift into different species and there's been so much deception that at times their problems seen insurmountable but the hero Aren never has any doubts about his lady. He's hard wired to protect his Alpha and pack and Sasha is &uuml;ber protective of her sister. Yet they find themselves pushing against the odds as they learn to trust each other. Lots of hot loving adds to the story.The only thing that might not sit well with some readers is the fact that we read it as first person as each chapter is told from the point of view of either Aren or Sasha but it just felt seamless to me as the writing flowed so well. The author makes you feel part of the story which only enhanced the experience.  I haven't read the first book and now have to seek it out and I'm very happy to recommend this book . Also I'm so intrigued to know what happens next as there is a certain wolf that I feel will be getting his own tale next( pun intended!) .",4

There are some very interesting characters with a mix of pirates, spies, scientists, military, priests, etc.It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that if God pronounced judgement on the demons that they could get around it by taking over human technology.  But this is a work of fiction after all, so not a big deal.  My only real ""complaint"", and a minor one at that, is that at times the story was really choppy because of how much explanation was interspersed between the lines of dialogue.

B002XOTPZW,A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"03 19, 2010","Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Solid Addition to the Series,"If you're unfamiliar with Mary Hughes' Biting Love series...well...rectify that as soon as possible, but don't start here. The series starts withBite My Fire: A Biting Love storyand continues with the stronger second installment,Biting Nixie: A Biting Love Novel, and they're fun, relatively light, but definitely sexy/steamy/erotic vamp romance novels that blend humor and danger together quite nicely. The Bite of Silence is third in the series, but a short story instead of a full length novel like it's predecessors. Hughes has managed to condense the best parts of her books and deliver a powerful, funny, sexual, and surprisingly complete tale in a much smaller package. I believe, however, that this story would definitely feel lacking to anyone unfamiliar with the series, so start from the beginning.In The Bite of Silence, Nixie's best friend Twyla, Admin. Assistant for the mayor of Meier's Corners, is off to the Big Apple for a little New Year's Eve partying. When she boards the plane, however, she finds the object of her most delicious fantasies seated in first class. Niko is tall, dark, and destructively gorgeous...and Twyla's also pretty sure he's a vampire...but he's stubbornly refused to give her the time of day since he moved to town, so a two hour flight with the vamp is JUST what the vacation gods ordered. But Niko's not as unaffected by the delectable and funny Twyla as she thought...and her ""vacation"" surely isn't going to go as smooth as she'd hoped when she realizes that someone's trying to turn all the vampires in NYC into slavering, bloodthirsty beasts as the ball drops on the New Year and Twyla and Niko are the only two who can stop a madman from destroying them all.Points to Hughes for delivering a very well-rounded story in such a short format. There's even a bit more character development than I'd anticipated - and something that's so often lacking in stories of this length. Admittedly, I've read the first two books, so I'm already familiar with Hughes' world and vampire mythos, and I DON'T think that the book would read nearly as well for someone who isn't, so I rate it four stars for lacking any real world building at all. Other than that - very well told.",4

The relationship with her boyfriend suffers and they break up.She tries suicide but finally finds someone she feels understands all she is going through and falls in love with him.

I actually read the first six books practically in a few days with very limited sleep.  I had to find out what was going to happen next from book one, and this sequel totally delivers!  I continue to enjoy how Lissa is developing as a character, and how she deals with the very limiting and strict vampire rules in view of her uniqueness (as a female vampire and her unique abilities).  I also like that the author acknowledges these harsh realities in the way that Lissa reacts to her situation vs. just ""sucking it up"" so to speak.  I'm not as enthused about the romance side of the story, and frankly I'm not really impressed with the males that Lissa has had to deal with.  She is clearly an independent and strong character, caught in a situation that she is doing her best to get through.  I credit the author for the very strong emotions (pissed off or really sad) that I felt throughout the book as Lissa goes through each success and trial.  It's that good!",4

To look at him, one might wonder if he was alive or only a wax figure; his eyes were unblinking and the rise and fall of his chest were barely perceptible. His gnarled hands rested lightly on the arms of the chair in which he sat, their occasional tightening the only real sign of the emotion he was feeling.""Pale winter sunlight, so typical of early January, was valiantly trying to brighten the large, cluttered room. Its weak rays crept past the heavy velvet curtains and cast a beam across the floor, creating a bright swatch in the otherwise gloomy interior. Small specks of dust drifted lazily on the faint air currents before settling on the laden surfaces of the tables and shelves.""Sculptures, figurines, and books, covered every flat inch of the room. Similarly, artwork filled the dark panelled walls, yet the gentleman in the chair still deemed his collection to be paltry and inadequate. Or, at least he'd felt that way until now. Years of searching and gathering everything related to his favourite theme had finally paid off.""Not sure if ""panelled"" and ""favourite"" are French spellings so I'll move on. I'm terrible at typing anyway. For me this one opened too slow. The painting of the scene was fine but kept waiting for something to happen on the first page. I'm anxious that way.

I definitely need my head examined so that I can remember that NA reads are meant to be adult reads, with explicit sexual scenes or foul language.  The sexual explicitness is what qualifies this read as &#34;adult&#34;.  However I do like Moore's writing style, so I took a chance on it.Moore can easily develop her characters into believable beings, with hurts and pain and regrets.  And since it is a new adult read, these same characters have tremendous sex drives.  They are smoldering for each other....Ouch!  Hot! Hot! and more Hot!  The conflict exists between Laney and Rue, Ryder's mother and her little protoge', Meg, who she thinks would be a good match for Ryder.  It's a good storyline with a Christmas setting, but really doesn't have much of a Christmas theme.  With only approximately 101 pgs, this novella is a quick read.

I gave it four stars for these reasons (1) I didn't really like Lexy because she was too bitchy and really lacked compassion (2) although there was danger the group Val worked for really seemed like a disorganized group rather then an elite government group and (3) there wasn't closure for what happen to one of the players, the relationship between Lexy and Hector or even her other brotherThe secondary characters Beau, Ethan and Red were interested and hopefully will get their own stories in this series. The story moved pretty fast and the tension between VAL and Lexy was good and we were able to find out why Val was as serious and as closed off as he was and alluded to in the previous books.Now that Ms. Burke has a new publisher lets hope that she will continue to be inspired and release more from this series and those of us that enjoy her books won't have to wait so long in between books.

Yep, I enjoyed the book; just wasn't real sure I should admit it.  I did enjoy the irony of Luther's demise.  Technicalities?  Well, I do doubt that a chow could yield the size steaks described.  In fact, while I've been in a couple countries that regularly eat dog, I've never seen the meat served as you would a steak.  What I am familiar with is dog served much like a chopped barbeque (often roasted on a spit) or in small cubes breaded and served with sauce on the side.  And it is generally understood that mixed breed dogs, for some reason, produce a better tasting and more tender meat than purebreds.  However, if you are using the coat for a coat, so to speak, I guess you take what you can get.  And I suppose I've seen too many mafia movies to question the sausage idea.  (No personal experience there, fortunately!)

Across the country, Greyson has become a chart topping heart throb with a soulful voice and a dark sadness that never leaves his eyes.  When the two meet again it is apparent that their love never died, but they don't know if they can move past the pain and distance to start over again or if it's possible to pick back up where they left off.I'm not sure if the feminine POV or the extended time with the characters helped, but this second book had so much more true feeling and intensity that I was looking for!  Zart gave both Lily and Greyson that soul searing, stop your breathe intense kind of love that is worth fighting for and makes you want to keep reading.  My only reason for not giving this book the full 5 stars is I started getting exasperated with Lily towards the end.

Enter to win one eBook copy of The Marquess of Cake (US) [Ends 11/18/2013]Digital review copy provided by Foreword Literary in exchange for fair and honest review.What can I say? Romance and sweets - I simply couldn't resist the temptation. And so I found myself with a copy of The Marquess of Cake, an enjoyable and quick read that certainly played to my sweet tooth.Alys Redcake is 26 and considered a spinster at her age, however unlike her younger sisters Alys has no wish of finding a husband and feels quite content working at her father's Redcake's Tea Shop and Emporium. She loves to bake and decorate cakes, but with her family's changing position in society her dreams of continuing on in her father's business are cut short. Devastated by the loss of her job and avoiding her father's persistent attempts at marrying her off Alys's only escape is ironically in marriage.""She foresaw some type of Jane Austen life, and she couldn't stand that lady's novels. So utterly dull, to think of nothing but husbands all the time."" The Marquess of Cake (p. 190).Michael Shield, Marquess of Hatbrook has a real sweet tooth, and an eye for a feisty cakie - Alys from his favorite Redcake's Tea Shop and Emporium in London. But Michael is a nobleman and with a younger brother as his heir, he is not looking for marriage until a mistake would change his plans...Victorian setting, a strong-willed couple and a story of their lust, marriage, love and of course desserts. The Marquess of Cake is not a perfect historical romance, but certainly a refreshing one. Bar the instant attraction this is not your usual insta-love romance, there is time for romance of course but it is slowly developing and neither of the characters truly grasps their love for each other until it is almost too late. And it is certainly fun to watch the developing relation between Alys and Michael. Both have their own struggles to overcome together and on their own, and at the end, learn to trust and rely on each other.I admit I was pleasantly surprised by this novel and if you are one of those people who judge a book by its cover [ducks head -- guilty as charged] I suggest you don't dismiss this one right away as a quickie romp. The author does a fine job keeping to the Victoria setting and not letting the characters get away with too many actions contradictory to the time period, which is certainly a refreshing touch. With both lighter and darker touches, some family drama and interesting secondary characters [Lewis in particular was a favorite of mine] there is plenty to keep the reader's attention. So, if you are in the mood for a lighter historical romance this one is for you.Happy reading!",4

They rounded out the plot and I loved how unique some of them were...like The Girls. I found it easy to visualize them and some parts were so funny that I had to read them out loud to my husband who also laughed. I found myself wanting to get back to reading the book and stayed up way past my bedtime, I read a lot of mysteries and many of them feel so predictable and artificial. This Mercy Watts mystery was a fresh and delightful change. I love her style and her interactions with family.

Fearing Sarabeth is next on the hit list, her friend sends in help, in the form of Gavin, a sexy, ex-Ranger Scot. Sarabeth isn't exactly on board with the plan, but her car exploding helps to change her mind.Gavin, with the help of his partner, Maddy, try to figure out who is behind the murder of Sarabeth's former coworkers, and Sarabeth moves in with Gavin for the duration. Smexy, and sweet, times ensue.What worked - Gavin...oh, Gavin...Such. A. Great. Hero. Strong, resilient, a fairly high amount of the ""I'm not worthy of her"" vibe. And drop dead sexy. Gavin is so tolerant of SB (I'm tired of typing the whole name), which is saying something, because our girl can get pretty wound up. He finds her sexy, and charming, seeing right through her righteous b**ch act to the vulnerable woman beneath the surface.I loved Sarabeth (Not Sara. Not ever.) She is sassy and spunky as can be, willing to go along with whatever Gavin asks of her. Like when Gavin takes her along on a job. So funny. Pyew! Pyew! Ah...you'll know what this means when you read it. Anyway, SB is a psychologist, with a dysfunctional family life. She was so excited about her new job opportunity, until her ex-boss ended up being a lying, blackmailing scumbag. Now she is trying to reestablish herself professionally, without accepting help from her family. In a seriously heartbreaking scene, SB calls her grandparents to let them know she is in hiding with Gavin, and the conversation that follows is truly awful. Bless Sarabeth's heart, I just wanted to give her a hug.There are so many funny elements in Guardian For Hire. The ""Pyew!"" thing, the bodice-rippers Gavin hunts down for SB, the climbing of the fence...too many to name. This book is a great blend of suspense, humor and sexy times. The dialogue is snappy, the mystery/suspense is okay and the pages flew by.What didn't work as well - ***SPOILER*** The obligatory ""I can't declare my feelings first, so I will leave and wait for him/her to come to his/her senses"" scene. That said, the reunion scene is worth the price of admission. So is the epilogue.Bottom line - Funny and sweet, a cute tale of two lonely people who manage to find each other. Time and money well spent!",4

If you haven't read Lifeless (book 1) please do or you will be hopelessly lost for the first couple of chapters like I was.My Beautiful started off strong, right into the story and never stopped. I got a quick feel for the characters and their chemistry. I was a little behind the eight ball not having had read book 1 but I didn't let that stop me. JM Larocca writes a beautiful character with lots of personality and story line was good too. It was nice to read a story where the focal point wasn't the hot n steamy sex...it was the suspense. Would Kade and Scarlett get back together, would Scarlett start dating Bryce? Could Jules or Brent be working on the side with Frank? or the Trapani's??? Once I got the feel for the characters and the story dynamics, I really didn't want to put the book down until I knew for sure if I could be right. So I read and reead...forsaking facebook, dinner, dishes and laundry! Even though I read book 2 first, I've already gotten book 1, Lifeless now sitting on my kindle. I'm going to go back, read Lifeless and then My Beautiful all in a weekend so I can reap the full benefits of JM Larocca's talent.

It picks up when they cross paths in a hotel in Las Vegas where Holli is reluctantly taking part in a business conference. Her love life is in the doldrums and he&#8217;s a frigging flirt with a skirt. However, as soon as they set eyes on each other, magnetism palpitates and innuendos flow. Could either of them envisage the outcome of their scorching night together? Well, you will see what happens when you read their story with all its ups and downs, but lacking in twists and turns for my liking.This book isn't erotica. It&#8217;s sexy and believe me when I say that they&#8217;re at it in nearly every paragraph! If the storyline had had more backbone, something more to grab at, it would have been absolutely brilliant! I couldn't possibly fault the banter between this horrendously sexy rock star and this up and coming independent woman. There is no doubt that you&#8217;ll laugh out aloud? One would expect their lifestyles and personalities to clash but the author has made these two diverse characters work to a tee. I loved Tracy too! Hollie&#8217;s best friend and secretary plays an important part and Danny! Ooohh Dani! Why Hollie&#8217;s hunk of a neighbour was left on the sidelines is a real shame!I assumed that this novel was about the title. &#8220;The Resistance.&#8221; I got the impression that the author had tried to involve the rock band in this light-hearted read, but somehow it just didn't seem to work for me.

I hadn&#8217;t read any Cara Dee before, but was hearing great things about this book. I am so glad I decided to read it. I can&#8217;t wait to read more from her. Cory is a total klutz. He can&#8217;t keep a job because he is always dropping, falling into, over or on top of things and breaking them. Flynn has a great job as the webmaster of an interactive adult entertainment website. It&#8217;s all about public displays. Of anything.The site is for adults who like to watch or be watched having sex. Sometimes in the privacy of their homes, sometimes in a public place. When a member wants to put on a live show, they post the location, day and time on the message board. Then other members show up and hide so they can watch. Many times, one or more of the watchers records the performance and posts it on the website for those who couldn&#8217;t attend live. Sometimes, they even stream it live as they are watching it. There have been repeated requests for Flynn to put in a public appearance, as no one has ever seen him.Flynn and Cory frequent the same bar and often notice each other there. Neither has approached the other for different reasons. On this day however, Flynn hears Cory complaining to a friend that he has lost his job again. What neither Flynn nor Cory&#8217;s friend know is that he has also been evicted and is carrying his worldly possessions in his duffel bag.Flynn approaches Cory with a unique business opportunity. He wants Cory to be him. Well, the public him anyway. Flynn doesn&#8217;t have the confidence in his appearance to put on a public display. He thinks the gorgeous Cory would fit the bill nicely. He wouldn&#8217;t even have to show his face. He could do a solo performance in a window with his face covered. The money is too good to refuse.A friendship based on mutual attraction and shared insecurities and losses develops between the two men. They each take a closer look at their pasts and how they really feel about them. They encourage each other to overcome their insecurities, growing closer and developing less than platonic feelings along the way.The Public Display of Everything doesn&#8217;t refer to what I, and I&#8217;m sure you, initially thought. Well, it kind of does, but it actually describes the willingness of the main characters to put their feelings on public display, not necessarily their sex life. This is a sweet, funny romantic story. The sex is hot, too! I&#8217;m proud to publicly display my recommendation of this book.",4

Malloy has always dated women so he is completely surprised by his reaction to out and proud Crispin. He is drawn to Crispin right from their first meeting and they quickly form an easy friendship. But a very unexpected kiss between them some raises disquieting questions for Malloy about his sexuality and their relationship takes a very unexpected turn.Malloy is the quintessential strong, silent type. He cares deeply about Eddie and Jim, the other two full time ranch hands and he is devoted to his foster family but he finds it difficult to express his emotions. Instead, Malloy demonstrates his love through his actions and he takes his responsibilities as ranch foreman very seriously.Crispin is the anti-thesis to Malloy. He is self-confident with an out-going personality. Crispin is comfortable in his skin and his sexuality. But his sweet exterior hides a backbone of steel and he stands up for himself when he needs to. And as we soon discover, Crispin carries wounds from his past that are not quite as healed as he thought.The romance between Crispin and Malloy is sweet, sexy and angst free. The chemistry between them is palpable and there is plenty of sexual tension as Crispin and Malloy explore their burgeoning relationship. They also share a deeply emotional connection that only grows stronger when their future is threatened by a heartbreaking chain of events.Crispin's arrival shakes up the status quo, not just for Malloy, but for Eddie and Jim as well. Both men are hiding secrets of their own and Malloy is stunned to discover how little he knows about the ranch hands. An unexpected tragedy makes it clear that it is time to tackle an escalating problem head on and this story arc will be further explored in My Heartache Cowboy which is due to be released in January 2014.My Cowboy Heart by Z.A.

B002FSTJOS,AST7XM0F9CN5H,"05 11, 2012",Diana (@Offbeat Vagabond),Great novella for LOTU fans,"Lords of the Underworld is one of my favorite PNR series. When I started it, I did not know about the short novellas between some of the books. The Darkest Prison is the first novella right after Reyes and Danika's story in The Darkest Pleasure (they have a cameo at the very beginning actually). The book follows Atlas and Nike, god and goddess of Strength. The way it starts really has you questioning the romance between these two. I honestly thought I read the synopsis wrong because they did not like each other at all.We find out very quickly that Atlas is quite the ass. I did not like him because he basically acted like a scorned frat boy. Nike hates him because he used her and threw aside like trash. But Atlas finds that once Nike is in a cage with her ex-fiance, they both try to one up the other even though Atlas says he doesn't even find Nike attractive.I love seeing how their hate for each other developed into something past lust. They both stopped being stubborn and/or forget the past and saw they were the perfect match. I especially loved how Atlas changed his views of Nike and didn't treat her like the prisoner he kept her as. Even though it might get him in trouble with Cronus who doesn't care at all for his Greek prisoners (duh). Not to mention that ending. It really put a smile on my face. Nike puts the bad in badass.Nonetheless, this was a fun and sexy short read. It can be read without reading the main books in the series, but I wouldn't recommend that. This series is too good to read halfway and you will be missing out on some amazing and very gorgeous men. So high recommendation for LOTU fans and newbies alike.",4
B00A72OGAG,A2H587O1MJCEL9,"07 2, 2013",BigAl,Thursday's List,"In the name of the series that Thursday's List kicks off, Kemanis describes it as a ""legal mystery."" I'm not sure I've heard that description before. Legal thriller, sure, that's what John Grisham writes. Mystery, of course. There are a bunch of subgenres, but typically in any of them you'll have a protagonist who is attempting to solve a mystery of some kind. Figure out whodunit, whatever ""it"" is, often a murder. Then we have the police procedural or detective fiction, which could be viewed as a mystery with a police detective or private investigator looking for whodunit.Thursday's List has some qualities of all of these genres, but doesn't clearly fit in any of them. We'll start with mystery. There are many mysteries in Thursday's List, yet in a typical mystery novel there is one clear mystery: something happened and the protagonist has to figure out the whodunit to complete the story arc. We don't find that here. It feels more like a thriller where someone is in danger of some kind, whether physical or just threatened in some other way, and the protagonist is the focal point as they try to work their way through to the point where the danger has been neutralized. In fact, calling the book a legal thriller would be the most accurate. However, it differs from the norm in that genre because the lawyer at the center of the story is most often a defense lawyer, providing legal protection for ""the little guy"" against the more powerful. Here we have an Assistant District Attorney, a prosecutor, as the protagonist and a less well-defined threat. With the District Attorney's office investigating, we also have a few qualities from the police procedural.All of that above was my exercise working out on (virtual) paper why Thursday's List seemed subtly different from the books I've read before, even though I've probably read more books in any one of the genres discussed than in all other fiction genres combined. It's past time to mention that I liked Thursday's List. A great set of characters with some that I'm sure will be doing encores in future books in the series, with the protagonist, Dana, my favorite of the bunch, which is how it should be. A plot that is different, largely because of all the things I talk about above, with qualities that would appeal to fans of any of those genres.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

B00I15VJX8,ATUYML6XAT0EY,"07 13, 2014",hc,A ticking time bomb...perfect description,"Having had the chance to read both I See London and London Falling, I can say that I truly enjoyed London Falling that much more...and I really liked I See London!! Perhaps it was because I really wanted to read more about Samir and Maggie but I felt they were so much more interesting a pair than Hugh and Maggie in the first book. The focus of this book is more on Maggie and Samir's relationship which was nice. The secondary characters, though are key in a few parts of the story, really take a back seat in this book.Maggie and Samir couldn't be more different from each other which made it that much more interesting to read about them. A lot of the book highlighted the massive difference between the two--everything from their cultural differences to their walks in life. There was a huge emphasis placed on how rich Samir is and how poor Maggie is. Surprisingly, it wasn't ever much of an issue between the two of them. Refreshing since money is usually a big divider when it comes to social circles. Another interesting emphasis was placed on Samir's culture and how different his life is from that of your &#34;average American life&#34;. His family legacy and its dependency on him to take over as head of the family and business when he finishes school is something that isn't something easily understood but interesting to learn about.The timing of the novel--Maggie's second year back at the International School--works out well for a chance of a continuation. Will the couple continue on to be so insanely in love with each other or will their relationship settle down and fizzle a bit? I'm also interested in seeing if Chanel Cleeton goes on to write more (perhaps a story for Fleur?)!",4

The one night stand that wasn't, the federal investigation, the &#8220;I can't protect you if I'm this close to you.&#8221; moment, sure it might be a little formulaic but that didn't impede my enjoyment of it at all. This is a quick read with a fair amount of suspense. The bedroom scenes are mostly closed door but there is still plenty of chemistry and sexual tension between the characters. I also really enjoyed Zander (Brian's K-9 partner), I would have loved to see more of him but it was a short book. I will be eagerly awaiting the next book in the series. I do wonder if this will be a series where the characters from one book interact with characters from other books or if it's more a series of standalones with a common theme, I guess we&#8217;ll find out soon.

B005PP3DVS,A263UA9W8JV38J,"01 7, 2012","Phoebe V. Brooks ""author of Gambling with Lov...",Unrelenting misunderstandings,"I think it was Susie Bright who said writing erotica was just like writing any other genre, just with sex involved. I wonder if MF Sinclair knows of this quote, because that's exactly what's accomplished in ""Dom of my Dreams"", and what sets this novel apart from so much of the other erotica published currently. In my opinion, this story wasn't written with the express and sole purpose of arousing people--although this does happen--but so that readers can learn of the two main characters' (an editor and a writer) intense and troubled developing relationship. ""Dom of my Dreams"" actually reminded me of the premise behind ""The Story of O"" (I've seen the movie, but haven't read the book.), with the female character's introduction to BDSM and her deepening feelings towards her Dom. Unfortunately, the novel also brought to mind the more mainstream printed romances with the characters' antagonistic beginnings and the unrelenting misunderstandings that keep them apart. This frustrated me. There were just too many twists and turns and I sometimes found myself thinking, ""Enough already"". The female protagonist's self-pity also rankled at points. In short, this book could benefit from another round of editing. Still, on the whole, I enjoyed myself. The sex scenes were fabulous, captivating, exciting, and arousing, and I often lost track of time. I figure that speaks volumes for MF Sinclair's work.",4

This is definitely more of a New Adult, even though the first two books were completely clean and easily YA. Although I was pretty surprised with what Pagan let Dank do before she remembered him, especially since she said she had never gone that far with a guy before. I also really didnt like Jay and Nathan and all their casual sex. So uncomfortable. And it really makes no sense that Jay was Pagan's soul mate. They didnt even like each other that much. But I am glad that it made things easier for Dank.It was really sweet to see Pagan fall in love with Dank all over again, and they rarely got physical in the first two books, so this is like candy for Dank fans.

I may do some experimenting with my coffee purchasing thanks to Thomas. As a devout animal lover, I related to many of the H.D. and Bean&#8217;s comments regarding people vs. animals. The backgrounds of these characters are so different, but they share similar values, which made the magical elements in the book come to life.

B002GYVWAK,A295A2TPG8JJ7Y,"02 14, 2012",Librarian,"Very good, but not best, Verne collection.","Of all the Jules Verne ebook compilations containing 30+ titles currently available in the Kindle store, this Halcyon Press edition is pretty good. An active TOC pinpoints specific content. I am particularly happy to see a full and modern translation of ""20,000 Leagues"" by F.P.Walter (though he is not credited and his informative, introductory essay is not included). I'm also glad to see a true (""Professor Lidenbrock"") translation of ""Journey to the Interior of the Earth"" rather than the sadly all-too-common bogus (""Professor Hardwigg"") version often passed off as being by Verne. The other major works are translated reasonably well keeping in mind that these are older, public domain versions. I do, however, prefer a slightly different public domain version of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Dick Sand,"" but that's a mere quibble.I have two more quibbles. FIRST is that several times a graphic will not be included but the words ""graphic appears here"" will appear instead. SECOND is that italics are often represented by an underline before and after the emphasized word(s), __like this___, a confusing annoyance when the names of several ships (normally italicized) are being referred to. These are not deal-breakers but something you may wish to consider (and because of them I have subtracted one star). The formatting is otherwise okay.As to containing 36 works, the count is inflated a tad by counting the two parts of ""Captain Hatteras"" as separate entities and unnecessarily including (and counting) a duplicate portion of ""Mysterious Island.""  You really get 34 distinct tales (not 36)--but that is still a lot of Verne, though it is by no means complete. That honor goes to Delphi.Delphi has a truly complete set, though a dozen works (not yet cheaply available in public domain translations) appear in French for the sake of completeness. Since I am not fluent in that language, I do not fully appreciate their inclusion. I do, however, greatly appreciate the inclusion of about 20 (!) more titles--in English--than this Halcyon (or any other) set. This makes the Delphi edition the largest and most appealing to me (even though the aforementioned modern translation by F.P. Walter is not used in it).I would encourage you to search, sample, and compare because new Verne collections keep popping up all the time in the Kindle Store. Check to see which titles are included, if the main TOC is active and takes you to additional active TOCs (one for each book), and that the text is formatted to your liking. See if graphics and illustrations are included. The one you ultimately select will depend upon the level of your interest in, and the degree of your enthusiasm for, the writings of Jules Verne. If you want a substantial collection which includes the well-known great Verne classics, this Halcyon set (or a recent, $.99 one from e-artnow, which is worth examining) should be quite fine. But if you want even MORE (as in EVERYTHING), the very BEST is that all-inclusive Delphi set.",4

B00CNX3NM4,A2BX2H27OJTPMB,"05 15, 2013",Lena Grey,The Laird's Forbidden Lover by Amelia Gormley,"What would you be willing to do to be with the person you loved? Iain Munro of Amelia Gormley's book called 'The Laird's Secret Lover' loves Tavish Macintyre and, more than anything, wishes he could be with him all the time. Iain is torn between his desire and what he knows to be practical. When Tavish's sister comes up with what could be a solution, he sees no other way but to comply and hope for the best.Tavish is young, impetuous, and very much in love with Iain. He refuses to believe that there's not a way for them to be together, but hasn't a clue as to how to achieve this goal. He's totally impractical, blinded to reason by his feelings. He's uneasy about his future responsibilities as Laird of Creachann-Dubh and, if he could, would give it all away to be with Iain. He follows his mother's orders as best he can, but when it comes to marrying, he adamantly refuses. Even though he knows it is dangerous, he seduces Iain over and over again not being able to control his desires and their love and lust grows. He simply can't seem to stop seeing Iain. When he fears that Iain has been unfaithful, it breaks his heart. He's jealous and hurt, but part of him still wants to believe in Iain's innocence.I liked both men, but Iain was my favorite. He's such a good person, honest to a fault and hates the deception necessary in order to keep him and Tavish safe. He's worked his father's farm all his life instead of being raised in luxury like Tavish and has a more practical, down-to-earth view of life. He'd like nothing more than to be with Tavish all the time, but he's more concerned than Tavish about being caught and ruining their reputations or worse, while engaging in risky behavior. He'd rather die than put Tavish in jeopardy or by dishonoring his father and his family, especially since his father is so sympathetic with his position. Poor Iain is miserable and unhappy, but his love for Tavish spurs him on and he doesn't give up. In the same practical manner in which he approaches his life, he embraces the opportunity to be together as the only way and embraces it, doing his part regardless as to how drastic it may seem.It's sometimes difficult to read a book with flashbacks from the past, but this one was well organized; the time periods are clearly delineated, eliminating any confusion that might otherwise have been caused. The story is written in a lyrical style perfect for a historical love story set in Scotland in the 1800s. It's obvious that a lot of research and planning went into this book because of the accuracy involved in the descriptions of the people, their colorful speech, and their customs. I loved the Gaelic words and phrases used. The period writing created a special ambiance enhancing the romantic element of the tale. Amelia captured the angst, sincerity, pain, joy, longing, and desperation of the two young men with such honesty and depth that it made me want to cry more than once. I totally sympathized with their plight. This is a deviation from Amelia's typical style, her first plunge into the area of historical writing, but she obviously has a knack for it. I, for one, hope she continues.If you want to escape into the past and experience a different time period when things were not as easy for two men in love but who managed to find a happy ending, then you may like this book. Bravo, Amelia! Thanks for the lovely romance.",4

Lori is a fashion designer who&#8217;s supposed to attend the Pacific Northwest Fashion Trade Show. She designs handbags and now has a brand new product: a discreet pouch containing all things a woman needs during an unexpected romantic date. A handbag that contains lip gloss, a fresh pair of panties, a packet of make-up remover, a mini toothbrush with paste, ibuprofen, a pouch for cab fare and a breath mint. And there is the third companion, The Blue Cat, JJ&#8217;s pet, who constantly sleeps on Lori&#8217;s clothes spread all over the room.When Lori and JJ come back to the hotel room, Lori realises that her brand new design is missing. The panties are missing, but who on earth would steal underwear?After constant arguing about Blue Cat sleeping on Lori&#8217;s clothes, JJ has previously decides to set up a video camera on her laptop to monitor the room. Seems it wasn&#8217;t a bad move after all, because the camera definitely captured something.Is it Blue Cat?Or is it someone else?Who and why would steal panties, for god&#8217;s sake?Ok, I haven&#8217;t read a book like this since I was a child. It&#8217;s a light-hearted read perfect to read after a long and draining day at the office. Or after a long day doing housework and running after the kids.I loved both JJ and Lori, and definitely Blue Cat. They are all great and so easy to love. Their constant fights over trivial things were just too funny, but what I loved the most is the fact they stick to each other no matter what. They are great friends and the dialogues they had made me laugh so hard.Overall, this is quite an entertaining read. It&#8217;s funny and easy to read, and I&#8217;m certain those who like chick lit and cozy mysteries will enjoy it.",4

Don't get me wrong, I love romance, but after reading so many in one genre, one right after the other, I need something completely different to give my brain a little vacation.I'm reading in other reviews that people are calling this horror, and I completely get that.  It's not horror in the bloody gory scare the pants off of you way.  It's horror in the mess with you mentally way.I loved a lot of the conversation between characters in this book, deep stuff.  Whether there is a higher power, good vs evil, free will and reasoning, is there such a thing as a soul that can't be corrupted?  Those kind of topics were what was going on in the tavern between Gabriel and Liz.  I love having those discussions with people who can have them in a non-angry, my way or the highway manner and that's how these two did it.  Then Kamilah comes in.  From her description, I assumed she was going to be on the the focus was on in the book.  I hadn't read the blurb because I like to surprise myself, but because of how she was introduced I couldn't help but zero in on her.Now, I don't want to say what the evilness is in this book, what it is that is in her nature because I spent most of the book trying to guess that one myself and I hate spoilers, not doing that to you.  I was surprised though with what the darkness of her nature actual was.  When I found out, I was thrown a bit.  I had never thought of this as pure evil before.  Mischievous, slightly evil, yes.  I guess if I were to really dig deep into the lore behind this particular being, I would come up with more than what I already know and that yes, throughout the ages, members of this group have been known to be very evil. I guess I have always thought of them as gray (the ability to choose between good and evil) beings vs white (always making good choices, almost as if they have no free will, they always choose good) or black (more than likely to choose evil).  This was definitely an interesting take for me.I loved it.  Absolutely loved it.  I remember catching myself holding my breath at one point during the book not knowing what was going to happen to Gabriel.While it didn't scare me, it did freak me out a bit.  Excellent book if you are looking for something different that will mess with your head a little bit.  I would definitely pick up more books by Mayra Calvani in the future.I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.",4
B006IYRVHM,A310KT1UQC5UNU,"09 13, 2013",Reading Fanatic (CMP),Sweet Regency Novella,"I really enjoyed Nash and Julianna's story.  Julianna is staying at Nash's family home during the Christmas holidays with her family.  Nash's older brother and Julianna's sister are married.  Nash is from a large, boisterous family of five children. Nash is the second oldest and the only unmarried one, except for his youngest sister.  Both Nash's father and Julianna's are Earls.  Nash has recently retired from the Army and is looking to settle down.  However, so far he has been unsuccessful in finding a young lady he would like to marry.  Julianna, on the other hand, is determined to never marry.  Nash is attracted to Julianna and his feelings for her grow as he gets to know her better.  Julianna realizes that Nash is unlike any other gentleman of her acquaintance, but is still determined to remain on the shelf.  How Nash convinces Julianna that they belong together makes a very sweet story.  FYI Nash is 34 and Julianna is 24 for those of you who like to have more details in reviews...lol.  This is definitely a sweet romantic story....very clean.  The author keeps the characters' behavior true to the time in which the story is set, which is shortly after the Napoleonic war.  Despite its short length the author managed to create a story that leaves you feeling completely satisfied at its conclusion.  Both the plot and the characters are fully developed.  I would definitely recommend this story.",4

B00L3HL52Q,A38EZGWVNDWDFG,"07 6, 2014",Tina,My First EM Lynley,"Bound For Trouble contains all the ingredients I love in a great book. A broken hero searching for redemption, a young man trying to escape the unfortunate circumstances of his past, undercover informants, hot sex, BDSM, action, a twist, then another twist, and romance.Daniel &#34;Deke&#34; Kane&#8217;s life is pretty much destroyed. He made a bad call at a drug raid and two kids died because of it. He has been haunted night and day by memories of that night. Once he is finally cleared to return to work for the FBI, he is confined to a desk job in Cyber Crimes, his boyfriend has moved out, he is lonely, doubting his own abilities as an agent. He is just a mess.After years of supporting himself in various ways, all involving using his body, Ryan has finally been presented with an offer to free himself from the world of a sex worker. A customer of his at the strip club where he performed has made him an offer that is too good to be true. You know what they say about offers like those. Gregory has hired Ryan and his roommate Gina to work at an organic grocery store he owns and chance to go back to college. All Ryan has to do is be willing to give up life as a stripper. Ryan is deliriously happy for the opportunity and quickly agrees. Ironically, when he tries to do the right thing, he ends up being forced back to the world he wanted to escape.When Deke finds some financial irregularities involving suspected drug dealer and weapons broker Maksim Petrov, the FBI decides to try and insert a confidential informant into his organization to get more information. Deke is offered a chance to work the case, while being closely supervised, and he gratefully accepts it. In his mind this is his last chance to redeem himself and save his career.Deke and Ryan are brought together when Deke is assigned to supervise Ryan while he works under cover at a gay BDSM club frequented by Petrov. Deke has a bad feeling about the club, Dungeon 69. He is uncomfortable but also drawn to the sexy Ryan and to the BDSM he sees surrounding him at the club. Deke must learn to trust his instincts again or risk losing Ryan and his job. In the past, Deke's instincts haven't always synched with FBI policy or the orders of his superiors.Ryan is able to catch Petrov&#8217;s eye and signs a contract to begin his sub training with the suspect. The dynamic between both Ryan and Deke and Ryan and Petrov is captivating. Ryan knows he is falling in love with Deke, but is also drawn into Petrov&#8217;s Domination.  While having to spend time at the club to watch over Ryan, Deke discovers he may be bent toward Domination himself. He is also falling in love with Ryan. Petrov is an enigma. Everything we think we know about him may or may not be true.My problem with the story is that for most of the book, Ryan is with someone else. It's all part of the investigation, but Deke has to watch Ryan get spanked by another man. And he sees Ryan liking and desiring it. Ryan is confused about his feelings because he has never thought of himself as a submissive person. It was hell to read about him being with Petrov. My heart hurt for Deke to have to see and hear everything they did together.Bound For Trouble is fast paced, well written, riveting. The roller coaster ride of emotions the reader takes is one you will want to ride again. The characters are well-rounded and intensely written, the plot is intricately woven and has twists you won't see coming. E.M. Lynley wrote this in a way that makes the reader feel the excitement and action. And the sex! There was something for everyone. From a timid first-time spanking to a full on single tail scene. The sex was really hot. But it wasn't only about the sex or the BDSM. Bound For Trouble is the complete package, with ingredients for everyone; mystery/thriller/romance/BDSM/action lovers alike will all enjoy this book.",4

It's touching, wonderful and heart wrenching.Jo has moved halfway across the country to start over. She's divorced from a high profile Arizona Senator and wants to start over where no one knows her. She moves to Georgia, buys a ""fixer upper"", and falls in love.Hawk Stephens is a horse-whisperer. He's working hard to get a therapeutic ranch up and running in Arizona. He's attracted to Jo and vows to win her over. He's certain she's meant to be with him. His Apache roots and beliefs have shown him what he knows to be true. He only has to convince Jo.Hawk was the perfect man. He was relentless in his pursuit. This doesn't mean he stayed in her face and demanded things. He gave her space when she needed it. He listened to her and paid attention to the signals she was giving off. It was nice to have an alpha male (and believe me, he's an alpha!) that wasn't beat on the chest, me man - you woman. Don't get me wrong, I like those, but it's also nice to have a different kind of alpha male. Change of pace and scenery.Jo was pretty amazing. She's been knocked down but she didn't let that stop her. She was cautious but she still believed enough in herself to trust her instincts. It served her well.Jo made some hard decisions that could have very easily cost her dearly. She was willing to risk it all in order to give the man she loved, everything he was working for, everything he dreamed of. That takes an inner strength that not all people have.Kendall Grace managed to create characters you care for, cheer for and hope their struggles are all worth it.I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley.",4

Down and Dirty was absolutely everything I wanted,  but nothing I was expecting in the best possible ways. Sexy, flirty and oozing with fan-yourself moments, new and old fans of the Dare Me series will be ravishing this book in one sitting!I loved Cat Thomas in the first book even when she was only on page for a few moments. Here in Down and Dirty, she's front and center and she was just as awesome as I first thought. Cat was super loud, fun and totally adventurous. Cat was type of person to chase after danger and go after the excitement and I loved that crazy side of her. I especially adored the fact that she was really loyal and one amazing friend and sister. Admittedly, sometimes Cat needed a good wake up call because she was so stubborn and hard-headed. I understood her fear and her reservations when it came to love and relationships, justified or not. I loved seeing this vulnerable and weak side of her underneath the tough and confident front she always puts on because it made her seem much more real. Even though I wanted to shake the living crap out of her half the time, I loved Cat all the way!Shane Decker was in no way boring in and out of bed. I loved Cat, but I loved Shane so much more. Smart, successful, totally cool and level-headed, this man was determined to win over Cat. He was hot as hell, completely charming and a strong guy with a really big heart. He was adorably sinful. He saw what he liked and went after it and this is what I loved most about him. With all of Cat's hot and cold, pull and push craziness, he still stuck to his ground and never gave up on Cat. He wasn't afraid to tell her the truth whether she liked to hear it or not. I seriously could not get enough of Shane, he was just perfect.Christine Bell has made me swoon all over again! I love her writing and her ability to weave in a gripping storyline with incredible characters and heart thumping romance. Her sex scenes are scorchingly sexy and absolutely dynamite, I could still feel the goosebumps on my skin. The chemistry she created between Cat and Shane was explosive. There was so much sexual tension from the moment they appeared on page. Christine totally made this tunnel vision, zeroed-in connection with Cat and Shane where you couldn't see their tethered link, but you could feel it. It was breath-taking and had me wishing I savored this book just a bit longer.All in all, what Christine Bell crafted with Down and Dirty was a lusciously seductive story about opening yourself for someone, letting them in and getting over fears of commitment. This book lives up to its title and so much more.",4

This one really added to the series!,"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comFight is a short prequel in the Fierce series by Clarissa Wild. This story can be read at any point in the series. Even though this story was really short, I thought it was a great way to start off this series. It packs a lot of information in such a short amount of pages. We get to meet Autumn and also her friends Brody and Evie. The story starts with showing Autumn and Brody at a young age. Autumn is bullied from the start and is constantly made fun of. She seeks comfort with Brody. But when Brody heads off to college she feels truly alone. She meets Evie, and they bond over the fact that they are both loners that suffer from bullies. Just when Autumn finally finds another friend and things start looking up, her family receives some devastating news.I really enjoyed this story and getting to see everything that Autumn had been dealing with. I felt so bad for her because of everything that she was going through not only at school but also at home. This poor girl just couldn't catch a break! I really liked Evie and Brody though, and I am excited to get more of all these characters. I also really loved that Autumn had received a note telling her that she deserved more than what she was putting up with from the bullies, and I think it really helped her turn things around.

Portia MacIntosh wrote a fab book.The book was written from the perspective of Nicole, a journalist who spends her time touring with the band Two for the Road, a band in which she has a massive crush on one of the members. I loved Nicole, she was fun and likeable and who can&#8217;t relate to having a crush on someone famous? There was a whole host of other characters in How Not to be Starstruck, not many I found that easy to connect with but they did bring a lot of entertainment with their crazy antics. Dylan, Luke, Charles et al all brought something to the story and Nicole&#8217;s dialogue with them all was easy to enjoy.I never knew which way this book was going to turn and I commend the author for making this book unpredictable because it makes you turn the pages and not want to put the book down. There were a lot of moments when I laughed out loud, which was exactly what I was hoping for.Can I mention the cover now? Because it&#8217;s gorgeous! I love it.

What an interesting story about how the world as we know it changed when earth passed through a meteor field.  This is a futuristic story that because of the `Great Concussion' actually reverts human kind back to the very basics in living but with a great split in humanity.The Mutah are the `unaturals' whose physical forms changed in sometimes big ways and sometimes small ways.  From extra limbs or tails to special skills or hair the color of `morning glorys'.The Cleaners are the `Normals' who were not changed.  Their goal is to rid the earth of everyone who was not `normal'.  That was what they were taught through generations.This story is about an unnatural Atty, who is an awesome hunter for her village.  Her dark blue hair is her `special' distinction along with her skill with a long bow. Yulen is a soldier and the Battle Lord of his compound. His attack on her village starts a chain reaction that takes them on a journey of discovery for both sides and shows them that ""love is transcending"".I enjoyed the writing overall however there were a few times it dragged a bit, though nothing major.  The end even had me shedding a tear or two.  Yul was a fun character who I believe changed the most in this story with his views and his overall acceptance of others.

Yes, it's weird to be comparing a book and a movies (or several), but there you have it.  It's like taking the movie 'Heathers' and mixing it with 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', then add a dash of 'Scooby Doo' and 'Fight Club'... maybe even a sneeze from Gossip Girls.  The 'Heathers' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' represent how much darker it was than I anticipated.  'Scooby Doo' just ALWAYS comes to mind when you mix teens and a mystery.  Fight Club, because nobody talks about Fight Club The Assignment.  Everybody condones and/or participates in The Assignment.  You can't avoid The Assignment.  The sheer amount of angst and 'cliques' and high school pecking order is the sneeze from Gossip Girls.Odd mixture, right?  With the exception of the beginning, when I was trying the learn what The Assignment was, why one would want to avoid it, and drowning in angst (oh, boy, was there ever angst just dripping from the pages like water); I was sucked into the pages.  The early parts, as I mentioned, was a little more of a battle.  I needed chapter breaks and tried to express to my husband (unsuccessfully) what was going on.  I wanted to share- I think this would be a fabulous buddy read choice!  The mystery lead a nice trails of breadcrumbs, although it's set up where I NEVER would have predicted the end based upon the beginning.  Pieces started falling into place quickly enough to engage me (especially getting me over my initial awkwardness.)It's that early stumbling and battle to get snared into the story that really docked that final star off my review.  That, and I wanted more Casper (I'm selfish, yes, I'll admit I love me some goth/emo guys) and I really fought against the mature residents of the town and their reactions based upon past Assignments.  I just, as a parent, can fathom an entire town supporting this for so long.  It just grates against me so much- and that contributed to my early reluctance.  Ultimately, if you don't mind a more vanilla YA romance mystery with dark overtones of the underbelly of mob mentality, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up.  Once I was finally hooked, I fell hard and crushed on Crushing Summer!I received a complimentary copy from the author in exchange for an unbiased review as part of a Love Between the Sheets blog tour.

His latest fling though is a 20 year old intern, the daughter of a friend, and when Colin's secret becomes public, Tori is finally forced to make a choice, but can she trust herself?Misconception is an emotional domestic drama exploring the issues of trust, communication and fidelity in a marriage. Hayes contrasts the relationship between Pace and Jason with that of Pace's parents, examining the issues the couples face and the differences in how they choose to deal with them.Pace and Jason are characters that are easy to relate to, married for a few years they are happy but under pressure with children and work and the intimacy of their relationship is a casualty. Realistically, I think Jason's reaction to Pace's unexpected pregnancy is understandable, even in the most ideal of marital circumstances and Hayes captures the doubts, fears and resentments caused by the situation perfectly.The relationship between Victoria and Colin also has the ring of truth and I thought Hayes demonstrated Tori's conflict about the state of her marriage credibly. There is no mention of this plot in the blurb which is a bit odd since it does have quite a lot of significance. While the two plots intersect nicely, I think they could have perhaps been meshed a little more.The writing is solid and Hayes demonstrates a good grasp of realistic dialogue. There were a few minor errors in the text but they are barely worth mentioning. The pace is good and I found it an easy and fairly quick read. I must mention that the title is an inspired choice with it's dual reference.Overall, Misconception was a pleasant read with an interesting scenario that had me considering what my reaction would be in similar circumstances. Commitment is just a concept until it is truly tested.",4

Her world is becoming more complex and rich. The pace is very good and although the suspense is not deep, I devoured the pages just to know what would happen in the story.There are some drawbacks, however:- Munro seems to be a super-character, who is always discovering new and powerful abilities.- The druids are always using magic without knowing exactly how. That is, where others expend years to master it, they simply are inspired and always correctly guess what they must do.- A important character hides a fact from another and it is never explained nor the outcome of this act is known, although it is deeply related to the plot- From the very beginning, you know who the villain is, even with some misdirection Ms. Drummond tried to useAlbeit these points, the book is very good and a awesome addition to the series.

The characters are very believable and interesting. Nick West is required to take out a known terrorist who had been reportedly killed in a sanction over six years ago. He has resurfaced and has a plan to kill those responsible for the failed sanction on him and earn a tremendous amount of money with a new biochemical weapon that makes Anthrax look like a bad case of the flu.The plot is very intriguing and high paced. At times I couldn't stop reading while others I questioned the feasibility of the time frame. The thought patterns are well developed but just as I was settling in and catching up with characters and plot, I was whisked away to another tangent. If that is the author's intention to keep the reader off balance, he did an excellent job.One minute Nick West is taking his orders from Oelxia Syshchenko (a member of a covert agency in Ireland) to kill the terrorist. The next he is Boston with his old pal ""Dog"" Dawson roughing up drug lords and then is on the West Coast looking for his target who had just released a small dose of the bio-chemical weapon on the man who informed on him many years ago. For those of us who remember end enjoyed the Andromeda Strain, then you are sure to enjoy the bio-chemical compound.I actually believe the author got so wound up writing it, he forgot to slow down and take a breath.

I found each part an ideal read for times when you haven't enough time to get right into a long story.The books are well written, with only a few errors here and there but nothing that put me off. Perhaps I'm more forgiving of errors than some I've seen in other reviews. I operate on the premice that we're all human, and errors happen. My enjoyment comes from the images the writer creates in my mind, and Jennifer has done a great job of that.I also read the ""About the author"" bit at the back of the book and discovered she's a military wife, as am I, so she gains even more respect from me for being able to juggle life, kids, and so on, all whilst finding time to craft awesome stories.I fully intend to buy more of her work and am heading now to add more to my GR TBR list. Consider me impressed.In this book we reach the climax of all of the short stories and I genuinely enjoyed reading them all. I liked how we discovered more about Alice, her character had grasped my interest from her introduction.Pleased to read of the Arcadia Falls series too.

I'm a bit apprehensive reading books about so many supernatural beings because in the past I haven't seen it done very well. There's often no solid story, or the characters don't actually have any characteristics.In this case, there was a bit of the author telling me what was happening rather than showing me. And maybe I missed it, but I don't actually remember getting a description of many of the characters, including Logan. Even Gerard I only remember his eyes being described and later on his accent. It doesn't bother me too much because I just constructed what they looked like in my head, but for those who want to know exactly how the characters are supposed to look might get ticked off.One other thing that bothered me too is that when Logan first witnesses the fights, the first description of each person is how he couldn't really see what was different about them, yet he still believes they're supernatural. Like the zombie, yet after being so doubtful about everything once he steps in the arena and someone tells him that the regular looking person is a zombie then he's a believer.Those (actually quite small) issues aside, I really enjoyed Into the Night. I thought every single character was portrayed excellently; they had specific characteristics and they stuck to them. I hate it when books will change a person's traits just to fit the situation (cough cough Mockingjay) so I was super ridiculously excited about everyone staying true to what and who they were here. I had strong opinions about basically all the characters, which means I cared. I thought Zane was depressing. Penny irritated me beyond belief with all her secrets. Gena was sweet but misguided. AJ was too spiteful. But the thing is, I still really liked all the characters. Even Gerard and Jackson are well done. I hated them, Gerard for what he has done and Jackson for what I know we will find out he's done later on. I know there's something there, and I have a theory, but I'll keep it to myself in case I spoil it for anyone (or myself).I give this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'm so mad about the cliffhanger! I got sucked into the story and even got all teary eyed at one point (which hasn't happened in a while) and then it just ends and I'm so not a patient person and I want to see what happens and I'm mad at the author for making such an excellent cliffhanger.

The sex in a relationship after the couple has been together for a long time starts to become boring and routine, to the point in which the couple does not feel the need to even have sex. This is where the use of ""Best Sex Positions"" by Stephen Williams comes in handy. There are tons of positions listed in the book, which are going to make a couple bring back the spark in their love life. Yet, these positions are not so complex in which they cannot be completed by the couple, something, which other sex position books never, take into consideration when they offer suggestions.With this manual in hand, a couple can revive their sex life easily with the information being given. Williams has always been known for providing common advice, which is going to help even the most hopeless couple out there. After reading ""Best Sex Positions"", I found it easier to see why the sex leaves a couple after years of being together and understand it is up to the couple to ensure they put the fire back into their relationship before it is too late. Williams can help to find the fire, which people have been looking for. For those who try this, they are going to find that it is the best way to get the fire back into their relationships and keep the intimacy alive. It is highly recommended to those who want to add more fire to their lovemaking.",4

It was funny, it was heart breaking, it was super sexy, and it's a book I can't recommend enough.The way they met was hilarious. I could not stop laughing. There was an insta-lust thing going on, but Marley refused to act on it. For one thing he's her boss, another thing he's a serial monogamous dater and she doesn't date, and the last he has a girl friend. She might not be a relationship kinda girl, but she's not they type to come between someone else's.Despite the girlfriend, Rick finds every opportunity to flirt with her. Not just that, but he's super protective. He walks her to her car every night after work, and refuses to let her leave with one of her hook ups. He even deletes every guy's number from her cell phone. Usually, that would irk me as a reader. I hate when the alpha male gets too controlling, but it was different with Rick. He was alpha, but everything he did was because he cared about her.When Rick breaks things off with his girlfriend, things heat up between the two. He keeps trying to get her to become more serious, but his work there is temporary and he will be leaving in a few months. She refuses to spend the night with him, and he thinks it's because she doesn't care about him. The real reason is heart breaking. I felt so bad for Marley.Marley's family is amazing. They are so supportive of her and each other. I'm thinking of starting Dish and Dish with my family. Such a fun idea. They had such a great dynamic, I wish I could be a fourth sister with a cool music inspired name.I knew I was going to love this book, just from the title alone. I wasn't disappointed.

B0088NH1VC,A3MZRWIB2TR99P,"03 25, 2013",Melissa,Good Tie Between the Two Kagawa Fey Series.,"I had an interesting experience reading this short novella from Julie Kagawa's Iron Fey series because I have already read The Lost Prince, first book in the Call of the Forgotten spin-off series. This novella focuses on Meghan and Ash's quest to find out the meaning to the Oracle's prophecy that their soon-to-be-born son could cause the destruction of all of Fairy. Eventually they find that their son will be involved with Meghan's brother in some way. Tragedy might ensue. Having already finished the first book in the spin-off series, I already know how these two young men will come to know each other. It still remains to see if they will be leading themselves toward fulfillment of the scary prophetic vision.It is a pretty strait-forward plot without a lot of bells and whistles. Meghan and Ash are there. Puck arrives to help them on their quest. Grim fades in and out to provide words of wisdom and guidance. It is all that I have come to expect from The Iron Fey series.I loved seeing the interaction between Ash and Meghan as a married couple. It was all that I missed from The Iron Knight story that concluded this series. Meghan is a strong queen for the Iron Realm. Ash stands as her knight and protector. Their conversations were probably my favorite part of this short story. Ash has a good share of swoon worthy lines. Call me sappy, but I loved it every time he called her ""my queen."" And when Meghan proves her action hero awesomeness? Ash's actions toward her were AMAZING. Loved it!Puck is Puck in this one. Maybe he was a bit too Puck, if that makes any sense. I liked seeing all sides of him throughout this series, and in this book he 'smirked' a little too often for my taste. But I still love the guy. Lots.Julie Kagawa's descriptive language is once again perfect. She paints a picture of the world of fey that is absolutely gorgeous. I feel like I am right there with the characters.Overall I would say that this is a great addition to the series for those who are already mega-fans. There is nothing about the story that is critical to know before beginning the spin-off series involving Ethan Chase, but it is still interesting to know the prophecy involving him. Knowing that makes me curious to see how the entire series plays out. Four stars!",4

That is until he meets Nara. Nara brings with her the smell of sunshine and flowers and Ethan finds she is all he can think about. And soon Ethan starts noticing things about her others seem to miss. What is it about that girl and will he chance rejection to know her more? You betcha he will.ETHAN is a really short read...a mere 50 some odd pages long on my nook. Readers get a special peek into Ethan's life before him and Nara; before BRIGHTEST KIND OF DARKNESS. I just loved being able to see him before we were introduced to him in BKofD but felt there was a part or two that was a bit slow. I know that is kind of weird since it is a short story, but it was to me. However, I do adore me some Ethan, so I will take whatever I can get and over look the small stuff.ETHAN is a great addition to a fabulous series. If you have read the series...pick it up today and get a better look at Ethan before you fell in love with him in BKofD. Haven't read the series yet? No problem. I think you should at least read BKofD first so you can appreciate this one a little more when you read it. Because when I read the last few sentences I had the biggest smile on my face.",4

B00JVX6XZS,A3KFTHKGVC63SL,"06 26, 2014",Michelle,Liam's List,"This book tackles a heavier topic than Vivian's List because Liam is deployed, along with Vivian's brother, Julian. Vivian and Liam maintain the long distance relationship but when Liam returns home, he isn't the same person anymore after experiencing catastrophic events that he felt were avoidable and now carries guilt for those events. It's a very good perspective of how people who serve their country really do make sacrifices and the consequences they face from the hands of warfare, physically and mentally. I admired Vivian for not giving up, because typically, most girls would and no one would blame her for it either. Liam was definitely never going to be the same Liam as before, which is hard for both of them to accept. Even though Liam still loved Vivian, he pushed her away due to his self-loathing blackness and starts spiraling downwards. This is not an uncommon scenario, but what can be learned from it is that while veterans may always struggle with the aftermath, they can still adapt back into society and function normally with the appropriate love and support, but they will never forget what happened. It is not an easy path at all, to admit needing help and then seeking it out. Liam has some fellow soldiers bring out important realizations to him and when he keeps Vivian as the focus of his universe, he makes that effort to be worthy of her. I hated that Liam had to experience that downfall, but even the strongest of people do, and had he not, he would not have been able to lean on Vivian, who proved to be even stronger than him.",4

I like that it wasn't the typical the hero is some rich billionaire and the heroine is a struggling woman&#8230;both were poor and struggling to make better for themselves.If you are expecting a lot  of steamy hot sex like this author usually writes, don't expect too much in this one.  It has one scene with sex, but that's about it.  It focuses more on the their lives and how they came about to be and find each other.My only issue is that it left me asking some questions, which it isn't the norm for me.  I wish it had an epilogue only because you left them struggling a bit, job less, starting out in a new relationship that neither of them were accustomed to, so I wanted to see maybe 2 yrs from now, how their lives were (like did they get a REAL bed!).  Also, the issue with Jessi and the kid.  Did she make it out, did Bobby regain custody, did Jessi turn back to drugs, her reaction to her friend&#8230; What happened?  Unless the author is planning a sequel with Riley and we get a glimpse of them.BUT good read and different from some that is out there (personally, I'm tired of the billionaire and heroine in distress, don't touch them).

Get. This. Book! NOW!It's sooooo good and I've only got a couple chapters read so far. I can't wait to see how it's going to go. It's going to kill me to go to work in a little while without finishing this. ARGH!More to come. *squeeeee*_________________Yay, I finished it and enjoyed it so much! As usual Gail takes us on a wild ride so hold on tight. I love Gail's imagination. I don't know how she can come up with so much crazy stuff but I love the end results in all her books I've read so far and this one is just as much fun.There are 2 things I need to mention though. The 2 main characters don't seem quite as fully fleshed out as some of her other characters. I think this may be because the story is quite a bit shorter than Vexing Voss. While it's still rollicking good fun, I was left wishing I had gotten to know Jaylan and Bree a bit better.Jaylan is a sweetie who is scary and nurturing at the same time. Bree is hysterically funny and strong and supportive. They are very good together.The other thing is the cliffhanger mentioned in some of the other reviews. I usually don't buy books with cliffhangers and I just wait until the whole series is written if the author has a tendency to write them. However this is the first time I'm glad I didn't know ahead of time that it was going to end in a cliffhanger as I might not have purchased it yet. Although, it's Gail we are talking about here, so who knows as I have to admit to being a bit fan-girly and stalkerish where Gail is concerned.However, this cliffhanger was not really integral to the story line in this book. This couple's story is wrapped up well even though it is obvious that the series is going to continue. The cliffhanger was tacked onto the end of this story almost like Gail just couldn't resist letting us know what is going to happen in the beginning of the next book. I would have been happier if she had just added it as a blurb for the next book rather than putting it this one as a cliffhanger. Gail doesn't need to 'prime the pump' with cliffhangers in my opinion. I'm going to buy anything Coletti that she writes anyway as I love her writing!So to finish up, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who adores over the top ribald sci-fi action, adventure and romance.

Will he change his bad boy ways? From the moment Char was thrust into his life by grandma something has been stirring in Jake. When he reads the letter from Kacey&#8217;s dad to him, all of a sudden things become clear to him.&#8220;My advice? Be the man. Don&#8217;t let yourself drown. Don&#8217;t run or swim away from the safety of the boat. The boat, that&#8217;s your home, your family, your life. The preserver that keeps you afloat will always be your wife, your partner. Without a preserver you drown, a preserver without something to hold onto has no purpose, so you see, you need each other&#8230; you need to rely on one another for everything.&#8221;&#8220;I guess what I&#8217;m saying is &#8230; love yer. Please her, cherish her, and by God, son, her smiles better outnumber her tears.&#8221;Life changes.. when the game of love becomes:&#8220;Life altering, earth moving, soul searching&#8221;Jake and Char, there is so much love between them, they just need to find each other. Grandma always knows best!! I don&#8217;t know why they ever doubt her. LOL&#8230; I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did. I give it a solid 4 stars! I truly hope this is not the last we have seen of the Titus family. That Grandma is a character and a half. I really feel there is more to her than anyone could ever guess.  And we all know Grandma is definitely not done meddling in the lives of loved ones:Jake Sighed.  &#8220;It&#8217;s like waiting for the storm to hit. No matter how many times you scream &#8216;Hurricane, take cover!&#8217; the poor unsuspecting victims just stare at the sky in awe.&#8221;&#8220;Grandma has that effect on people.&#8221; Char linked her arm with his.&#8220;I can&#8217;t look away,&#8221; Travis said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like watching a car wreck. You know you should call 911 and help, but damn if you can&#8217;t manage to do anything but drive by slowly and gape.&#8221;&#8220;Only God can help them now.&#8221; Kacey sighed",4

It reminds me a lot of Hunger Games but definitely more adult. Do I think the author was trying to create her own HG with Wicked? No. Was inspiration drawn from it? I&#8217;m pretty sure.Wicked starts off with our unlikely heroine (she is a murderer) getting ready for the Compass Room. What is a Compass Room? In the near future science has been accurately able to tell someone&#8217;s moral compass. When someone has committed a crime, or is on trial for a crime, they are given an option to choose the trial and what a jury deems your guilt, or a Compass Room.There are three Compass Rooms depending on the age range of the criminal. Once the Compass Room simulation begins, 10 criminals are constantly monitored and when if their morality is deemed evil they are executed. On average, only 2 people survive each &#8220;round&#8221;.Wicked is about so much more than you&#8217;d think by reading it&#8217;s synopsis. Wicked makes you think about what you would do if confronted with the same situations the characters are put in. Would you trust science to judge your guilt or your peers? Is it ethical for science to be able to judge your morality? It makes us think about our own legal system.I really enjoyed The Wicked We Have Done. There is a romance but it doesn&#8217;t overwhelm the book. I think because the book isn&#8217;t about the romance at all. It&#8217;s about surviving against the odds. Of course bonds are going to form, it only makes sense. Evie is such a strong character and is easily likable. Yes, she&#8217;s made her share of mistakes (hello, murderer), but that doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;s beyond redemption.I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll find yourself ever rooting so much for a group of criminals in your life. The ending ends in a great spot and leads right into the next book that comes out in September. I personally cannot wait for it. I need to know what happens next. How everything is going to be sorted out",4

This advice is priceless, because it is so very useful, and because there are so many people who just do not know about this information.The only reason this book is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that the recipes in this book are not generally for meals - they are for things like ketchup, maple syrup and savoury meatloaf.

This is a normal story except for the twist on the protagonist who is visually handicapped. Due to this handicap, the emotions experienced take on a heightened sensation and require extra attention to detail in ensuring there is chemistry between the protagonists.Sandra Ross has done a wonderful job in introducing a storyline that provides a refreshing view on the possibilities of love knocking on anyone's door.The background setting of the story in an isolated mansion is conducive for a relationship to develop between two people; romantic and sweet. The story begins with Ashley knocking on the door of the mansion wondering about her anxieties and feelings of whether she was doing the right thing. Her determination to improve her creative writing skills and to get hands-on experience provides her with the confidence to proceed knocking and entering her new career. This characterization reflects the strength and determination the protagonist possess in achieving her ambitions. The character of the other lead protagonist, Anthony Lang is also build up with similar traits.The story focuses on the intricacies of a relationship and the strength and determination required in sustaining a relationship especially where one partner has feelings of insecurity and wants to end the relationship. This is the focal point of interest in the story.Albeit an interesting storyline, the construction of sentences in the story tends to be rather loose. It can be further streamlined to provide a sharper focus on the buildup of the characters and their actions. Overall a good read.",4

I will be completely honest with you and say that I&#8217;m not sure I would have let my child read this book during his high school years. Yes the characters are that age, but this book recounts some pretty mature subjects including sexual abuse, mental illness, illegal drug use, and sex. As an adult I appreciated this book and the story it told, but I&#8217;ve got a lot of years of experience in which to handle everything that takes place in this book.Ellie Cox seems like a typical 16 year old; in high school, on the track team, friends and family, and a boyfriend who is crazy about her. However, Ellie is anything buy typical. Adopted at age 6, Ellie has no memory of her early years but lately she&#8217;s had dreams; snippets of memories that are dark and scary. Ellie is also having what she assumes are blackouts, moments of time where she doesn&#8217;t remember where she&#8217;s been or what has happened. From the beginning of this story it is apparent there is something going on with Ellie. It is hard not to feel her confusion, her frustration, and her fear. When her memory lapses start to affect her relationship with her boyfriend, Shane the stress seems to get the best of her and she begins acting out causing her parents and friends to wonder if she&#8217;s on drugs or what else might be going on with her. When she begins to get calls for someone looking for Gwen and when she meets a young man named Griffin who calls her Gwen she really begins to struggle.The writing in this story is so solid and the in-depth look at Ellie&#8217;s life is amazingly detailed. At times this was not an easy book to read as it depicts a young girl trying to figure out why strange things keep happening to her and afraid to share this information with anyone. It was hard to not feel every emotion right alongside Ellie. There were scenes that were hard to read and scenes that made me cry, but there were also some moments of great courage and an overwhelming sense of hope.Fragile Line is a brilliantly told and as an adult I can appreciate the complexity of it despite the distressing and heartbreaking nature of this story. That being said, while I highly recommend this book for adult readers, I don&#8217;t think I can recommend it for its intended young adult audience.Review copy provided for an honest review.",4

It's crazy how the mind works and what people will do when they feel that they have to fight to survive. Ryan is the definition of crazy though.

I just read this one and was so surprised that there were no other reviews. 5 stars!!!! A must read.It starts with Douglas who lives in Sommersgage House (which is really like a castle) and Julia (who just moved there) they just lost their siblings and were awarded custody of their nephew and 2 nieces. I love Julias strength, and the mystery that surrounds Douglas. The house itself has its own haunted story attached to it.There are heartbreaking parts regarding the children that have lost their parents, there are hot parts between Douglas and Julia, and there are parts where you want to jump in the story and rip Douglas's mothers head off.The end leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat, cheering for Julia, drooling over Douglas and wanting to throw a vase at Douglas's mother.A great book.

The story picks up really quick; it's one of my favorite things about this author she jumps right into the story and hooks you in so you don't have to wait a couple chapters to really get into it.So Ben is Molly's ex-army brother who just came back from war and decides to move in with her. We got a little hint from the last book that he may have an eye for Taylor (one of Hannah's friends from work at the coffee shop). Sensing this attraction Molly doesn't hesitate to play matchmaker between the two of them even though Ben has said countless times that he does not want a girlfriend right now because of the demands of his new job.Taylor on the other hand who is usually a strong and positive person goes through a pretty traumatic experience right off the bat putting her in more of a fragile state. Taylor still a little nervous from the event really just needs someone to be around her as she still gets scared by herself.Taylor and Ben become close pretty quick but neither of them really know what to think of it as neither of them are really looking for a relationship. I loved the connection between the two of them it really felt like they entered into each others lives at the perfect time and were able to be what the other really needed.I don't want to give away anything but I will say that I really enjoyed this story it was a quick fun read that kept putting a smile on my face. We still get a peek into the lives of the previous characters from this story which I love!! I cant wait for the next one, this time we got a hint so we know there will be another one; maybe Cam, maybe Taylor's roommate?!!For more reviews http://theetherealtimes.blogspot.com/",5

LOVED IT!!!!,"This is the second book from this author that I have read and just from the books I have read she is a born natural author in any kind of book she puts her mind to write.Shaggy Maggie was definitely a roller coaster in itself, the book kept me wanting to read it, needless to say  I stay up all night because I couldn't put it down. The descriptions in this book were to the limit where you could almost imagine yourself in it and the things happening to you while it was happening to the main characters which I love about books. Maggie has definitely made a good career for herself but once she hits Scotland, her world starts to go awry again!!! I really was feeling sorry for her because she just couldn't get a break especially when a stalker comes into the picture. When Maggie goes back to Scotland to meet her fianc&eacute;'s parents she meets the bully from her earlier childhood, Harvey. Of course he never really did forget her because he even named his band after her! How can they meet again after so long, well that is definitely a twist you will have to read because I almost choked laughing. Could they really have something that strong and end up together? What does she do when she is torn between the love for her fianc&eacute; and of course the boy that made her run away from high school?Let me tell you if you have not read anything by this author you are in for a surprise because one thing that I have learned and loved about her books is when you think you have figured out her stories WATCH OUT she throws a wrench in it and twists it around to a whole new direction. To me this one has definitely amazed me again at how talented she is and to keep stalking her (ok maybe not a good word since this book had a stalker but the author should know I have fallen in love with her books, hahaha). This is a book to a new series she has started and I definitely look forward to reading the next one. It is highly recommended by me to go grab your copy and read it now :)",5

B00A923TPM,ABXZMKZUIVBTI,"11 21, 2012",AngelDucky,You MUST read this book!,"What I liked:This was a fantastic book, not just because the characters were rich and drew me in, but because Mary tackled a subject so many people shy away from. Depression is a very real, very serious condition, and it's refreshing when an author isn't afraid to bring it up in their stories. Not only does the heroine suffer from depression, it plays a central role in the development of the story. It's handled beautifully and you can't help but root for Melanie. I liked the fact that the hero wasn't perfect either; Jack has diabetes and he handles Melanie's depression the same way he does his own medical condition: as a condition that can be managed and accepted.I adored the relationship between the Jack and Melanie, and damn was this book hot. The things that man can do with a banana ;) Well, you'll just have to read to find those out. Overall this is a wonderful book I highly recommend to everyone. If you want to read an amazing love story with a hero and heroine who are relatable and anything but typical, run to get this.What I didn't like:This isn't really a complaint, but I wish it could have been longer. I loved meeting Melanie and Jack and I wish I'd gotten even more time with them because it's rare to find characters I can identify with as much as I do with these characters.Overall Verdict: 5 Blue Duckies!!Note: I was provided a free eARC copy of this book for the purposes of writing an honest review.",5

Book 3 holds strong and is still a fantastic story. The final book in the trilogy grabs you from the minute you open the book and doesn't let go until the final page when you're left excited, sad and overall emotionally drained from the best book in the series. There were so many amazing things I would love to say but can't because they're spoilers!This book has a lot more depth and plot twists than the first two and I didn't even think that would be possible. Maggie's memories are back, a war is at the Gate and there will be no prisoners. Maggie is amazing in this book and between her and Jackson I wish there was another book coming, an &#34;after the war&#34; sort of thing. This book dealt with harsh topics, a betrayal from the end of the last book, war and vengeance. I think it stepped it up a ton and loved the more adult feel to this installment.Characters: There isn't much I can say on the characters without hitting spoiler central. So I will leave you with this thought. Don't judge any of the four from their pasts, don't make assumptions and be ready for Maggie to kick some serious butt.",5
B009WGJ3S8,A19V8EJVBEPF7X,"10 31, 2012",Kathryn Wozniak,ST Paul  Christ's Chosen Apostle to the Gentiles,"The Life and Prayers of Saint Paul the Apostleis another book in the excellent series of live and prayers of the saints by Wyatt North.  Many became disciples of Christ after the cruxifiction  but Saint Paul was the only one actually chosen by Christ when Christ spoke to him through the blinding light on the road to Damascus.The book gives a lot of interesting insight into his life before and after his conversion.  St Paul took the early Church from a Middle Eastern sect of Jews who believed in Christ to the world by bringing it to Gentiles and  the Roman world.  St. Paul with his teachings brought us  the path to salvation and God through Christ's love.  St Paul faced  many opponents and controversies in his beliefs of how Christ should be brought to the Gentiles.  Many in the early Church believed that Gentiles could not become followers of Christ without first becoming Jews.  St. Paul believed that the righteous came to God and Christ  through faith in Christ not by becoming or acting like Jews.I would highly recommend this book and all the others in the series,The Life and Prayers of Saint Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of Lisieux,The Life and Prayers of Saint Joseph,The Life and Prayers of Saint Thomas Aquinas, and the rest.",5

I couldn't wait for the next book to come out.  I am now hooked on this series.  Errol has stole my heart and much much more.  He made me interested in cooking again and not just in the kitchen.  If you haven't read Devour Me and don't want any spoilers stop here go read it and come back after you are done.At the end of the first book Taryn has left Paris as well as Errol.  She's back home helping her mother and brother with their restraunt.  She is easing into New New York life and even reconnecting with friends.  She still is hurting over leaving Errol and question if she made the right decision.  She knows that if she is near him at all she would lose all resolve.  Then smack there he is in her restraunt complementing her on a job well done. She is shocked to see him and he makes it very clear that he still wants her.  There is no doubt that she does but at what cost?I enjoyed getting to know these two some more.  They had a lot going on and it was refreshing to see Errol stepping up for Taryn.  He decided to help her when she needed it the most.  I didn't feel any alterior motives from him.  He cared for her, and she held a special place in his heart.I felt the book was the perfect length.  We meet Taryn's brother Bobby who is a lot like Errol.  It does help her see that things are not always black and white.  If she just would  take a deeper look she would see that Errol is sincere, attentive, and loving.  He shows her that he isn't giving up on her.  He has no plans of leaving her anytime soon.Another great book by Kailing Gow she's yet to write a book that I haven't liked.

Well first let me say what an ass I feel like because In my head I was thinking that this book would probably suck because it was a freebie. Can I say how happy I am to be so wrong? I started off reading this book at 10pm and told myself I would just read 1 chapter to see how I like it. Well 11:30 came around and I told myself I would stop reading at midnight and next thing I know it's 130 in the morning so I said ok when 2am comes around I'm putting it down. Needless to say I didn't go to bed till 3am and I had to wake up for work at 530 this morning. I don't know what it was I just couldn't put this book down. Yes actually I kinda do know what it was. First off Matilda ""Tilly"" totally rocks. I love how she is so hardcore but sweet and caring too! The best part is that she doesn't even know she's hardcore. She doesn't take crap ...well not a lot of it anyway and I love that about her too. Second reason I couldn't put this book down was because of Heller. Just when I start thinking what a douchebag jerk face he is for saying or doing something that pisses me off he does something else that makes me smile and sigh but then just like that he turns right back around and makes my stomach fall into my vagina and I'm cussing him out!! Also the side characters are freaking kick ass and i just fell in luv with Daniel and Niq..I'm officially addicted to this series and getting ready to buy book2 but had to come on here and give my review so those of you that thought like I did will know that this actually an awesome read.

B00HZZ6638,A2J36T6J3GWT6O,"02 2, 2014",Jennifer H. ~ Book B!tches Blog,LOVED IT,"**ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review**~~ 5 Forever Stars ~~&#34; Life is all about moving on and never forgetting the moments that test our ability to live.&#34;This quote sums up this whole series!!!!  This is the third book in the Never Letting Go Series and I thought it was a GREAT conclusion to the series.  Like I said that quote totally summed everything up for me.  All three of the books in this series tested the love and bonds between Adam, Sophia, Erin and Connor.  But each of these characters proved they would never give up on each other.  I LOVED book 1 Reaching Out for You ( Adam and Sophia's story ) but I have to say that I LOVED this one even more.  This book is based primarily around Connor and Erin, who we meet in book 1, but I loved that the author included Adam and Sophia in this story.  These four characters are so interconnected that I don't think she could've written this book without including all 4 of them in it.  I said this was a great conclusion for this series, because it truly did wrap up the whole series and gave us the endings for Adam and Sophia and Connor and Erin.  I loved that we got 2 epilogues!!!!  I also loved that this book was told in Dual POV's and with a couple surprise POV's thrown in there.  I thought this book was very well written and the story flowed really well.  This book has so much going on that it is actually a pretty quick read, because it keeps you on your toes.  Not only did we get a great conclusion to 2 wonderful love stories, we got some suspense and action that had some great twists and turns.  I will say that the suspense element was a pleasant surprise.  I totally didn't see it coming.Like I said this book is primarily Connor and Erin's story.  This book starts off right where book 1 ends.  Erin and Connor are in a relationship and struggling to find time together, because Connor is traveling and working so much.  I will say that Erin and Connor are thrown some really tough challenges in this book, but I loved how that in the end they always knew they had each other to turn to.  They knew that if they just trusted in each others love that they could get through anything.  There really was a lot that happened in this book, but I can't talk about most of it because it would spoil way to much of this book.  You'll just to read it to see what happens.  I still loved Erin's character in this book, she was a sweet girl who had some spunk.  She wasn't afraid to stand up to someone who might be a threat to her relationship with Connor, but she also didn't take any crap from Connor either.  Connor was simply AMAZING!!!!  He will forever be on my BBF list.  The love he felt and showed Erin was wonderful.  He proved over and over that he would do anything to keep Erin safe and happy&#8230;.No Matter What!!!!!Even though this was Erin and Connor's story we saw quite a bit of Adam and Sophia.  I loved watching the love story flourish and the conclusion we got.  I still LOVED Adam.  He captured my heart in book 1 and held on tight in this book also.  I will say Sophia kind of bugged me a little bit in this book.  She seemed a little whinier in this one.  I guess I have to cut her a little slack since there were extenuating circumstances.  Either way it didn't deter me from loving this book.I could probably go on and on about this book, but I will just say&#8230;.Go Ahead and READ this SERIES!!!!  You won't be disappointed.",5

In fact, I'm not just enthusiastic about the science of becoming a successful gamer. I'm more of an addict, obsessed yet determined to dissect the thought provoking tips and tricks of some of the world's awesome games especially Minecraft. I'm keen on transforming the way you play and bring you the latest updates and awesome tips. I'm out here writing this to &#34;Make a Difference&#34; in people's lives, one game guide at a time. And I challenge you to make the leap and become your own work of art. Passionate gaming is what brought me to this stage early on in my life and curiosity will bring me far beyond my wildest imagination...&#8217;The above was written in response to one of Adrian King&#8217;s games &#8216;101 Little but influential Minecraft Tricks inside Minecraft&#8217;. That book was about interaction of mind and dexterity and it obviously has caught on well. In this book, still accompanied by the excellent illustrative Lego like characters and places, is a straight on novella. Though short it is a well scripted fantasy about the town of Kremolla, an incurable virus and the strangely immune Cameron whose obsession is to reverse the viral plague while being stalked by a rather terrifying set of mutants/zombies who are victim&#8217;s of the deadly virus&#8217; infection. The story moves swiftly, takes some unexpected turns the way a good little thriller should and ends up with an ending that make sense. It seems Adrian King has found a fine matrix on which to play out his obsession with gaming! Grady Harp, November 13",5

As I a 60-year old gay man, I am not be the target audience for this book, or am I? Within me is that scared teen that didn't seem to fit in, fearful, withdrawn, looking for love and acceptance.  Thank you Victoria for writing a story that I too could relate to and enjoy.I recommend this story to teens and adults who enjoy love stories between young men who are coming of age and dealing with all of the fears and frustrations that come along with finding what direction one's life will take.  The vampire angle and the balance of light and dark are an added undertone that adds to the flavor of the story. It is nicely done without taking away from the central theme and challenges faced by the central characters. Love of a parent for a child, love of people for each other and devotion to what makes us one in spite of our differences are themes that is universal to the human experience. Victoria wraps it all up so nicely.Personally, I enjoyed this story a great deal and the characters are fascinating as they come to life with their unique qualities.  I highly recommend this story to youth and adults. Is a sequel in the future?",5

There are several books that I never want to end and this is one of them. What did I love most about the book....this may be cheesy, but it was the location, lol. I live about 45-60 minutes from where the book takes place (well, if I guess correctly based on the landmarks mentioned, lol) and that just made my day! Everyone knows that I love the south and anything that takes place in the south is A-OK with me! Oh...and my 2nd favorite thing....the main character is Paige Barnes----that is my maiden name!!! lolThis books takes place in 3 short installments, or you can get a copy that has all 3 parts in one. That's what I did, I don't think I would have been able to take waiting on the next book to come out if I bought them one at a time.Paige is on the run from everything. College, her ex and life in general. Her mom is a writer and just bought a camper and will be staying the summer at the beach. Perfect time for Paige to tag along and escape everything.Paige's mom writes about serial killers (hence the name, Serial Summer). I loved this about her! She gets out in the field and researches her topics and is really hands on with it all. The killer she is writing about now is a REAL killer (like really!) I looked it up because I am from the area and had never heard of him. It freaked me out! Who knew that happened in this little ol community! Anyway...off topic, lol.So Paige finds her escape in Ocean Beach, SC. Something is off, everyone seems to know her Mom and her Mom is hiding something about her past from her. They have more of a friendship relationship than a Mother/Daughter one so Paige pushes it aside and focuses on her problems.She meets cousins she didn't know she had and helps her mom research her book. All of this is enough for her to get her mind off things...that is until she meets Justin...(ahhh, Justinnnn) lol. I was so in love with Justin. He has the southern gentleman charm, works hard for what he has and works hard for what he wants. Justin is a college graduate, beach bum and kind of a business man too.Paige finds the escape she is looking for in Justin, but it comes with many warnings from family friends to not hurt him...he has trust issues. Paige's past shows up at her door one day and she dowsnt know what to do. All she wants is to escape, and maybe have a summer fling....but is that smart with someone who clearly wears his emotions on his sleeve?I loved everything about this bok!. It took me back to summertime and summer loves. Ahh, it was sweet and addicting. I want nothing more than for there to be a 2nd book so the story can continue.",5

So, I did wait to buy and read this book until I heard that the 3rd book will be released any day now. The story picks up right were it left off and I am just as hooked!I don't like to write spoilers but if you are considering reading this book, it must be because you read the first one...so here goes:Henry receives a letter letting him know about the accident and he immediately feels compelled to go and get Sarah to help her. Sarah returns with Henry to California in the hopes that it will help her remember her past. Of course, Will is completely shocked to find Sarah standing in his home since Henry did not tell him what happened and the story begins to unfold. Slowly, but surely, Sarah and Will form just as strong a bond as before but it comes with lots of twists and turns. Will is engaged to Margaret and has gone further in their relationship then he really wanted to and feels stuck with her. You will detest Margaret...omg...and I sincerely hope that we get to see justice come to Margaret in the final book! Just as Sarah is beginning to remember some things and her and Will have begun to get closer, you guessed it....angst! Adley, returns from the war to find Sarah, his fiance, gone. Of course, as soon as he is able, he if off to California to claim her back.The story telling is just fantastic and the reason for my &#34;but&#34; above with the 5 stars rating is simply that I wished the author just finished the story!

To give credit to Austin he has never behaved in a wrong way until now, and so, maybe to test him in a 24/7 situation, Zach decides to invite him over during a 3 days road trip that will end in Zach's parents home right in time to celebrate the Hanukah.Austin is not really happy of the arrangement, the car is fated to fail them and the weather is not good, but he loves Zach, and Zach is able to make sad puppy eyes when someone deny him something, and so here they are, in a cramped little car in the middle of a snow storm.Confirming Zach unconscious theory, the forced closeness brings out their worst sides, but it also allows them to understand that love is the most important thing, and that their love is stronger than shadowy memories from their past.Truth be told, Zach is the one who thinks the most and will mend most of his scars; Austin let it out here and there that his past was not happy either, and that on the opposite of Zach, he has not an idyllic relationship with his parents, but nothing more is said, and while Austin's secret desire, to build a family with Zach will be granted, he will still have the unresolved issue with his previous family.Of course, between open heart discussions, heated quarrels and sweet skirmishes, there will be also hot, very hot sex, with just that touch of kinkiness in the end to make the season naughty. Zach and Austin enjoy their sex, and even when they are a little angry with each other, the desire they have for the other will never lessen, so that it is always clear to the reader that they will be able to find an agreement, since a good relationship like their cannot be destroyed by something futile like silence or too much love.",5

Ok, I might have stuttered a bit there. This was the hottest book I have read this year! And I have read some hot fiction. I'm one of those women that doesn't mind her erotic fiction, actually erotic! I don't beat around the bush. If I am going to read sex in my fiction, I want to have an orgasm along with the heroine. And I think I had multiple orgasms while reading this story. And it wasn't just the sex! The story had me sitting on the edge of my seat and biting on the inside of my cheek a little. It has such a hot and impressive cast of characters. And you had a female villain. I LOVE FEMALE VILLAINS! It is like watching wicked woman only in a book!Let me first start off by saying that whenever I read that there might be some male on male action. I tend to avoid it. And I'm not by any means homo phobic. I just tend to feel like a scene with two men might just drop the Alpha male status for me about 50 degrees. WOW! I was so wrong. The first scene with Melania, Devnar, and Khilam... Can I just say that I actually felt like I had walked into my Kindle and was living that scene right along with them. WOW! OH MY GOD WOW!But like I said before it was not just about the sexual content. Though I will say again it was the best sexual content that I have read almost in FOREVER! I digress. The story, I felt such tenderness from the love story, and I was swept up in this intergalactic tale that had me wishing that this all was really taking place somewhere in a galaxy far far away! I have a few quotes that really grabbed at me. They made me hang on to the moment and it was where I got deeply involved in the main characters.""Because you aren't mine."" Her breath came out in a soft sob. ""Because you will belong to the empress, and I cannot have you. I'm so alone, and I cannot have you.""

This may not be a clinical break down of the plot line, and full character development or a 3000 word book review.

I loved the exciting characters, Professor Winston and his wife Murielle, because they had something meaningful to say about the world we live in today. I think Their journey searching for truth is actually our journey.Medler's novel presents something familiar but simultaneously distant from our lives, and this dissonance, it seems to me, lies at the heart of 'Fountain' and makes it one of the most interesting historical fiction I ever read!

And, unbelievably, stumbles upon a plot from a super-hero!This story was so cute!!

A successful divorce attorney, she can't let the local community find out she is a sexual submissive without losing her credibility. After dating fighters, she realizes she won't find what she needs in the way of kink, bit still needs a partner who can fight her and win her submission.Ethan is a cage fighter and most people equate that to him being not so smart. He doesn't make a big deal that he owns his own business. Expanding into the Chattanooga area, he enters a fight and meets Sam. Instantly attracted, he flirts with Sam, but respects her wishes to stop.When Sam shows up at a local BDSM play party, Ethan instantly latches onto her. He can give her the fight she needs and she will gift him with her submission and satisfy the sadist lurking in his soul.This was a refreshing look into BDSM. While it was more painful than I like to see, it was honest and the characters true to their needs and respecting the trust inherent in this type of relationship.Ethan is a sadist. He explains to Sam that he doesn't need to use all his power to satisfy that desire. He likes to inflict pain in a consensual way, but the power comes from the sub begging and crying, not from how much pain he can inflict. I loved how he takes Sam somewhere to talk before they ever scene together. Then he explains the scene very clearly to her so she knows what he is expecting. It was a scene clearly geared to learn about her and her pain tolerance, not for sex. In general through the entire book, Ethan does a wonderful job being a Dom. He watches Sam's reactions, specifically when he denies her the right to speak. Hand motions are given for him to slow down or even stop for a moment and then the safeword to stop the entire scene. What I really loved is how he put a paper in front of Sam with the yellow right side and red on the left side so she would know without having to think which fist to clutch. He seemed aware that when a sub is in a scene, thinking sometimes goes out the window and he didn't want to leave it to chance.Sam is a very complex character in how she has a very dominant lifestyle but really craves the need for submission. Her submission is never given freely because if she can feel she can kick the guys rear end in a fight, then they can't take her for what she wants. She is a tough as nails divorce attorney, but comes home needing to be a sexual submissive. Fighting is not just a hobby, it is a part of her life and she embraces that as part of her.There is a scene where Ethan and Sam fight so Sam can have her feeling of submission. My only point of ... well ... ouch ... was that they fought naked. Sorry, I can't imagine fighting with my ladies flopping and I can't imagine a guy doing the same. Other than that, I absolutely loved the entire scene as it was a genuine moment of BDSM between two consensual adults getting what they both need and want.I don't want to give away too much of the book, because reading it was such a joy...bad word for a BDSM book, but hey, it was refreshing to see an honest portrayal of BDSM even from a sadist and masochist. Most are portrayed badly, but this book allowed us to see the normal life side and the side that gets what it wants.An incredibly honest, refreshing and delightfully painful book.Warning: This title contains graphic language, consensual BDSM, bondage, and use of toys including crops, clamps, canes, and floggers.",5

And eventually a very happy reader!The story continues without a hitch and moves forward as I would never had imagined. After breaking my heart with the last book, this one continues on track and answers many questions.Niki is dealing with the effects from the last book, mourning someone she loved, and merely trying to survive from day to day. At the deep blue sea we meet her father (not Sasha) anddiscover that there is way more to Niki than could have been imagined. (Totally an understatement)As not to give you a plot summary, I will say this. . .Events with Sam (oops, a little spoiler there) are neatly handled, which still amazes me as I think on it! I was so a Sam girl and couldn't figure out how this could go well. . .We get more answers concerning Bobby Gage and the story continues to progress.Our heroine continues to discover more about herself and the role she will play in this saga. With the duties of death and the remaining powers of the creator, we discover more of who she is and who she will grow to be.  Death, life, joy, and sadness. . It is all there along with heart break and love.A total page turner of a book and never a dull moment!Spoilers. . .I admit, at first I was wondering how niki could become so fickle with her love interests and there are so many different ways this could have gone, but JL you truly pulled thorough with this one! Thank you for staying true to our girl and keeping the story arch true.  So, we were left with our hearts hanging out at the ending of the last book and thought of this great necromancer. Well, you are in for a rollercoaster ride if you thought this would go the way I thought it would. All I'll say is. . . Lucifer has stolen this reader's heart.Can't help but to wonder what the next edition will reveal. . . So many more directions to go!Eli?

Picture a 30-something single female on New Year's Eve hiding out in her friend's family cabin. Tamara doesn't want to spend New Year's Eve with all the other couple's kissing at midnight surrounding her, reminding her that she is just a poor lonely Kindergarten teacher. No thank you, instead she will drink the wonderful egg nog her friend left for her at the cabin. In fact, she may have to drink it all before noon as the cabin is freezing and it seems to be the only thing helping keep her warm since she ran out of clothes to layer and can't find matches to light the fireplace.Luke has just arrived from another tour of duty in Afghanistan. He wants to hang out at his family's cabin and then surprise his sister for her birthday. No one knows he is coming, especially not Tamara.This novella was a satisfying read, but I could definitely see how it could be expanded if Amy Andrews chooses to do a series related to these characters.

Alyx has so many conflicting emotions, but she is still the same Saraphelle, who thinks she has to do everything by herself without any help from those who would do anything to have the chance to prove themselves to her.Michael plays a small role in this book, the demons barely have any role. The book mainly focuses on Alyx and Jordan and trying to get the things needed to cure Israel before he dies. Of course Alyx has yet to tell anyone that Israel being kept alive has to do with much more than her love for him, since well, if Israel dies, Alyx dies. Mayrekk plays a good role in this book and it was nice to see him again, the silly old man is always a pleasure.As per Angelfire and Angelstone, Angelsong leaves the reader wanting more and the story comes to an abrupt end. Unfortunately, Angelblood doesn't release until next year so we're all pretty much screwed until then!As with the others, I recommend this book to anyone who loves Urban Fantasy and the ultimate battle between good and evil. There are some interesting things to be learned in this book though that will have the reader slack jawed for a minute or two.I give this book 5 of 5 paws",5

Unsurprisingly, when making catering quantities of any recipe, the slightest miscalculation of an ingredient can totally ruin a large amount of expensive food. Back in those days, that meant having something heavy thrown at you by the head chef / lecturer. Being on the receiving end of such an aide-m&eacute;moire did give you a good reason to be more careful next time. Perhaps you might have guessed who received more than a couple of these reminders?Aaaaaaanyway, had this guide, or the Internet, or political correctness been around when I was studying, I could have saved a lot of grief!Joyce shows you how to safely increase quantities of ingredients, which cheaper or more readily available ingredients you can substitute, weight and measure equivalents, how to prepare many essential ingredients, basic mixing methods and some top cooking tips for common types of recipe, and much more.This book is a must for any cook's Kindle!",5

Sorry to burst your bubble but I totally would have flushed my sister and still would if I had the chance.Anyhoo let's leave my Freudian sibling issues aside.My youngest son thought this book was great.

My son is seven, isn't an advanced reader and he had no trouble at all. Well maybe just when he giggled at words like slobbering or boogers. We also had a lengthy talk about the possible existence of toilet gnomes.For parents who want to read it to their children, it is fine for younger children also. It starts off with a warning about children not trying to flush siblings at home or elsewhere, just in case you have a child that might ponder and wonder at the possibility.

I wasn't sure when I was reading whether it was supposed to be funny. I felt a little uncomfortable when I would be cracking up at the author's descriptions or a turn of phrase, because it really does read like a serious book.  But then something would just sneak in, and I was rolling. It's by no means a comic/humor book. It's pretty serious (especially in the beginning), but there are some hilarious spots.  But then, there are also some very sad parts, and a couple that made me literally gasp.I truly loved to read this book. It is one of those that will stick in your head and heart. Great book!SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!!I did not like Maria. Sure, she was a good character, and I really liked that she treated Francis like he was human, and had fun with him and tried to make his life better. What I didn't like is that she refused to have any sort of relationship with him just because he was a quadriplegic, and would rather be with a man that beats her. I did not like that the ended up together at the end, although I did like the comeuppance of her husband. I guess Maria grew some as well as Francis and came to realize what is really important in life, however, I would have liked it better if she had realized that before he came to her a healed man.

The keeper, the delegation and the unrest, are split between Lir and the sun (Didalys), with half of them going to each.  The unrest, Lir's children, have been told that they will die if they touch the delegation.  Each group has a human seer that has been granted immortality in exchange for giving prophecy to the rulers.Vespera has taken over the moon and is getting increasingly irrational.  Things are not as smooth or peaceful as it would be believed.  Into this comes the watcher.  The watcher is an immortal, child of a keeper and human, who never knew his parents.  There are many immortals on earth, but the watcher has a job to watch the cataclysm, whatever that may be.  The only problem is no-one asked him if he wanted the job...and he doesn't.This story is fast paced, intense with a startlingly clear world that is easily pictured.

Fiona is in a fix...her situation is precarious as it seems she attacked her Dom, Deacon...and no matter if she is cut loose from the facility, she will still have charges brought against her from the assault. Oh, and there is the other complication... Fiona is famous... celebrity famous... paparazzi famous... and is known for giving them the perfect &#34;in your face&#34; shots... so they will be hounding her in droves.This gives you just a taste of this read... there is so much jammed into this novella...every page has either character development; seeds planted for understanding things to come or slightly veil revelations which then push more in front of us to ponder. We experience glimpses into the Drazen family which will shake you to your core. There are pledges between children holding secrets to be exposed at some point with full disclosure. We see siblings trying to help one another with surprising results; and we are introduced to a number of new players... and wonder just what their impact will really be... who are they and what exactly are their intent with Fiona...This is not all pretty...this is a woman who figured out a way to live... and whether she will Kick the correct addictions for her and keep the ones which she needs... because Fiona is strong in her own way... and we will see how all of this plays out when C.D. Reiss decides to give us more.A gifted copy was provided by author for an honest review",5

If you enjoy the arts, this is definitely a book to read. There's drama, passion, anger, performance, stress... I mean it's got it all... even a mini sexual scene (nothing on the Rated X scale though).There are so many different individual struggles and stories. You end up getting connected with several different highly evolved characters - My favorites being Anya and Darius. Of course I love Seb too! He's absolutely previous and really reminds me of Charlie from Center Stage. The main female character, Elena, is really likable. She's such a sweet soul but good grief is she dense when it comes to seeing what's in front of her. I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to jump through the book several times and knock her in the head!There was so much going on in this book it was like it's own mini tv drama regarding the arts... at first, it felt like I was reading a new version of Step Up 2... LOVE... then it merged into a little Glee... then it merged with Center Stage... then in the midst of it all was the Gossip Girl...The characters were really easy to like - or hate with regards to Letitia >_&lt; There were really serious issues in this book that were addressed as well = bullying, stress, passion, rape, overcoming painful pasts, how individuals can be misjudged by looks, sex & losing virginity, peer pressure, drugs... I mean, seriously - this book could become the next big performing arts show on tv! :) Instead of focusing on glee club, it would be more focused on dance. I like that idea!I really didn't want to stop reading this story. I finished it in about 5 hours total. I'd highly recommend this story to individuals who enjoy the world of performing arts - especially dance - and the struggle that goes into ""making it.""There will be a second book in this series and I wish I had it NOW!!

B008GTX3OM,A2HP20L24G3L5,"11 22, 2012",Neil,Every bit as good as Cory's spy thrillers,"""This is Jezebel"" features detective Lindsay Grey, a former policeman and is the second in a series of four, this one was first published in 1952, the same period that Desmond Cory was writing about his other well-known creation Johnny Fedora. I did not realize the timing of this publication until sometime after reading it and confess I was quite surprised he found the energy and imagination to release two novels but it turns out this was a very regular occurrence in his early days.If I was to be mean and critical I could say that the transformation from a spy to a detective is not a wide enough gape in the job spectrum to allow sufficient difference in the story line, I would also be telling a lie! Some of the writing style obviously remains with questions left unanswered until the end, an insight in to the characters personality and psyche, and a main character that seems to be universally likable.Now I will confess the world of art contains little interest for me, I cannot look at a painting and think much beyond if I like it or not to be perfectly honest and was therefore not totally how sure I would cope with reading a novel that is essentially based on a possible forged masterpiece or was likely to feature one if not more art galleries, and knowing how Desmond Cory was likely to describe the backdrop surroundings. In truth I should have known better and once I started reading, stopping proved difficult. The more Cory novels I read, the more I love his creativity, well researched and in-depth knowledge of what is taking place at any given time. The actions of the characters are believable, even when something happens that you perhaps were not expecting; it all seemed logical if you look at it from that characters viewpoint.Desmond Cory never seemed to fail to write original material that is gripping and full of suspense when he wrote his crime and spy thrillers and ""This is Jezebel"" is just another excellent example of his genius. It's another piece of his work that can be hard to put down once it has been picked up, opened and the contents slowly digested.I have read this novel three times and would say that if after a first read, you are unsure as to whether you liked it or not, read it again. There is quite a lot going on in the story and you may possibly have missed something that on the second reading makes more sense of what is happening.For me it compares favorably with his spy thriller works and easily on a par with them",5

Lazar ""mystery writer""","Jack Dance is the cleverest, nastiest, most accomplished sociopath ever to grace the pages of a thriller!","Jack Dance is the cleverest, nastiest, and most accomplished sociopath ever to grace the pages of a thriller. With no conscience and a devil-may-care attitude, this smiling, tune-humming, horribly handsome serial killer will make you shudder. His cavalier attitude when engaged in murder, his complete and utter lack of humanity, and the pairing of these attributes with the most cunning criminal mind of the century will linger in your mind long after you've finished the book.Jack had a bad experience when he was eleven. It had something to do with a blue-eyed blond named Meredith. And after stewing in hot rage for many years, he finally takes action. Her murder--his first--whets his appetite for what is to becomes a ritualistic re-killing of Meredith, over and over again.Aside from being a superb writer--I say this with complete honesty and zero exaggeration--Mr. Prescott is a talented plot twister who maintains tension and never, ever lets it slacken. Once you've read (or listened) to his books such at Stealing Faces, Blind Pursuit, or Mortal Pursuit, you'll learn that you'd best store up some extra adrenaline for the guaranteed ride to come. Deadly Pursuit is relentless in its suspense, and your favorite protagonist will be sure to partake of many successions of satisfying chase scenes with the villain. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: when it comes to writing thrillers, Mr. Prescott leads the pack.Steve and Kirstie Gardner head for a vacation on Pelican Key, the place of Steve's childhood summer vacations, where he and his pal Jack Dance explored and clambered over the ruins of the old lime plantation. Now the house has been restored, and it beckons to Stephen with an inexplicable urgency. He needs to be there. He craves the connection to his youth. And he worries that maybe--just maybe--secrets from his past might follow.The problem arises when Jack Dance happens to seek refuge on the same island when the feds begin to link him to the murders of the now infamous ""Mister Twister."" When Jack bumps into Kirstie on the beach, his thirst for blood surges, because as luck would have it, she looks a lot like Meredith.I won't spoil the plot by telling you more. Just rest assured that the ride is torturous and deliciously scary.This book is much more than a thriller--it's also a story that transports you from your armchair to a tropical island. I love novels with a sumptuous ""sense of place."" Deadly Pursuit propels the reader smack dab in the sultry humidity of the Florida Keys. I've never been there, but felt thoroughly connected thanks to Mr. Prescott's descriptions of the lush flowers, trees, wildlife and ecosystem. I am certain he must have frequented the location in person, so beautifully drawn were the scenes.I happened to experience this book in audio book format. The narrator, Christopher Burns, has an uncanny knack for voices, especially for the carefree, jaunty inner voice of a serial killer. It ""creeped me out"" as my kids would say, to listen to this sociopath in such an intimate fashion. Well done, Mr. Prescott and Mr. Burns!Highly recommended for adults by Aaron Paul Lazar, lazarbooks.com",5

B005KDCLHW,ASLSCL3KWHFSE,"09 12, 2011",Future Slayer Girl (aka: kitten),Bound for Pleasure,"Nothing is better to read than a sassy short. Not just a sassy short, but a sassy short with hot BDSM action. I have never really understood the dynamics of a female Domme and a male submissive, call me crazy but I adore me an alpha male. I just find it flat out strange to see a man submissive in any stage of life. For me the man is the rock (Coming from a total submissive kitten I think I'm mildly objective) he is the hear me roar figure. However, as I slowly dug into this sexy short I realized that a submissive male could be just as Alpha as a Dom, if not more. He essentially still controls the female's pleasure, her need to want more from him and break just as much as he does sexually. I have found a new liking to Dommes at this point are now a very intriguing idea for me, I now want to read more books with a submissive male, I have thoughts of a wicked woman kidnapping an Alpha and breaking him now. Thank you Ann, I so needed that wicked image in my mind.Her giggles overtook her again, and she had to breathe through them to talk. ""I have never, ever in my life, seen a man run so fast with a toy in his a**.""It was simple clever quips like that, that made the story that much more enjoyable for me. They were too characters that pleased me as a reader, they made me giggle, and they also made me breath hard and go ""Oh mama!"" The flow of the story was perfect; once I started I couldn't and wouldn't put it down. I wanted to know what would happen, the side story of possibly being caught by the Paparazzi added that additional element where you sort of bit your bottom lip while you were reading going ""No, no, no don't leave that room!""He raised his eyebrows. ""Lawyer, huh?"" You know, I can totally see you making grown men cry in the courtroom.""She grinned at him. ""You say the nicest things.""The chemistry in such a small amount of word count was actually totally impressive. I was so glad that the author provided me with a copy of the book to review. I loved every second of this short story and I definitely recommend it to anyone that likes BDSM or even a great erotic short.

It leaves no stone unturned. With all the information he supplies, I can't even imagine a fourth book. I feel like I could start my own little professional brewery and do a heck of a job.I now know what to key in on if a batch smells like wet fur, leather, a barnyard or has various other off-smells and/or off-tastes...how to kick start fermentation or pep it up...Questions like ""Can a bad batch cause death or blindness"" and are there such things as exploding ""beer bombs"" are covered. And yes, if I think about going into a homebrew business, I'd have to move out of the USA. Homebrew covers the all legalities.Thinking about brewing your own beer or looking for solution to your off-brews?

I had gotten this for free and then it just slipped my mind, sorry bout that Todd.Anyway, I love this story. Todd gives us a good tale about a woman whose mind is in a fragile state after her attempt at suicide. We see that she cares for her husband, which is sweet, and then suddenly she has to fight for their lives when her husband is taken by crazy cultists in the middle of nowhere.What I really like about this story, is how Todd shows us not only what happened to Karen before the story began, but good details about her, and how her mind processes everything during the length of the story. Also, just how far she's willing to go to save the person she loves. It's really good writing.But I also like the ending. I was with Todd when he did the live audio reading and I talked with him about it. I like how he ended things, and I won't spoil it, but it does take a different route from the norm, which is good.I cannot wait until he brings all of the stories he wrote out in book form, I will make sure to grab a copy.",5

What makes this book valuable is that he actually shows the reader, step-by-step what that looks like in actionable steps.  It is all too easy for many of us to get sucked into activities that have little to do with successful results.  The trick is to figure out which activities are actually producing results.  Scott shows the reader how to do that in simple steps that anyone can follow.  Great little book.",5

The secondary characters were also very entertaining--there are a lot of them from the previous books, but I thought their interaction was not overdone.  Suspense was good, and sexy scenes were spicy.  My only cons for this one was I thought there was ALOT on internal dialogue, both from the h and H (I tended to skim here a bit), and all the talk of binary codes was confusing (this is not really an issue with the story--it is a major part of the plot--I just had no idea what they were talking about :) !)",5

She makes you feel involved in the story, she makes you think about it well after putting it down, I dreamt about it... The song by Bruno Mars ""If I was Your Man"" I think should be theme song for this.

I wanted a best friend like Elora when I read Elfin and nothing changed whilereading Rapture. There is so much more to her than anyone could realize and several times I found my mouth hanging open at some revelations during this book.Oh, and let's not forget about Cush. He's every bit as dreamy and Alpha as Trik including badass warrior skills. Definitely swoon-worthy. Quinn never disappoints with her Alpha males.

Kimmel-Freeman ""Mom, Author, Blogger, Revi...","High seas, sexiness, and character dynamics that leaving you walking the plank for more!","Let me start off by saying I have a thing for pirates... there my bias is out there. Throw in female pirate and you might as well call me done because the combination, if done correctly, is killer.For me, Kary's take on a female pirate was spot on! I LOVED IT! I spent a lot of my undergrad years obsessing over pirates- especially females (don't judge me, we all wasted some time in college- my wasted time is clearly useful today, so there!), anyways, I learned a lot about them, their backgrounds, stories, tales, positions, etc... did you know that the famous pirate Black Bart has been rumored to have been a girl?!My point, getting back to my point, Kary does an expert job of blending the realities of pirate like with the sexiness and adventure that we all think of when we think pirate. Not only that, but she's thrown in the Gift element which borderlines paranormal-ish and OMG could she have written me a better book? I know, I know, it wasn't written for me, but it has so much of my favorite things.Truth be told, I read it one night because I didn't want to put it down. And I am SO curious about how Abby and Chad ended in the realm of the Light and not the US which apparently is in the same universe/time period, but not the same. OMG, please explain it to me. I HAVE TO KNOW! Just like I want to know if there are more books in this series, it is a series right? I've not been given this small piece of awesome, only to never taste another bit of it again! Say it ain't so!As you can see, I liked the book. I highly recommend it for you nautical lovers, you romance lovers, you royal story lovers, you paranormal/supernatural lovers, you fable lovers!

The opinion within this this review is entirely my own.There is no place like home, at least Savanna hopes this much is true.  After tragedy had struck ber best friend Cassie,  she packed he whole world in a moving van and left Texas once and for all.  Cassie had the unthinkable happen....the love of her life now gone. Killed in the line of duty as a fireman. Little did Cassie know it but Savanna had her own death to deal with.....the death of her marriage.Leaving Eric, her womanizing and abusive husband had been a blessing to Savanna and her daughter Aubrey.  No matter how far she ever got away from him though, the damage followed he where ever she went.  Now as she steps back into town to help her friend pick up the pieces,  it seems like she must start putting the puzzle of her life back together as well.lqI loved this story.  There is definitely tear filled moments .....but it only adds merit to the authors portrayal.  Cassie's grief is very real and accurately told.  The losing of a loved one causes a crisis in your life that simply knocks a person to their knees.  Savanna's story does gives us hope.  It shows that there are a few good men left out there.  There is life after leaving a domestically abusive situation.  Excellent flow of action as well romance.  Very good editing as well.  Sometimes as a woman you just need to sit down and read a book to inspire you.....this is that book",5

B00CNTTV60,A2T7T20XT8CHDE,"01 2, 2014",Carole's Random Life,Loved this goddess story!,"In the interest of full disclosure, I received an advance reader edition of this book from Entangled Publishing, LLC and Net Galley for the purpose of providing an honest review.I would rate this book 4 1/2 stars out of 5. It is the final book in a trilogy and I really enjoyed it despite the fact I have not read the 2 previous books in the trilogy. The first part of the book was slow for me probably because I had a lot to catch up on that was covered in the first 2 books. The book picked up at the 30% mark and I actually had a hard time putting it down the last half of the book. Seriously, Natalie J. Damschroder where have you been hiding?Marley is a goddess who no longer possess the typical power of a goddess. Marley now has the ability to nullify power in those who have power that is not rightfully theirs. She is trying to find the goddess supplying their male counterparts, the Numina, with power or flux. She is also trying to nullify the flux in as many of these men as she can. Once she nullifies a persons power, they are no longer able to accept power in the future.Gage, a member of the Numina, is also looking for the goddess dealing in flux and he is looking for his brother whom he fears is caught up in it. Gage becomes an unlikely ally to Marley and they work together to stop the goddess and her influence. The pair works well together playing off of the strengths of the other. As the pair are falling for each other, Marley realizes that the power she is nullifying is changing her.This book was very well written. The characters had a lot of depth and the chemistry between Gage and Marley was very believable and not completely over the top which seems to be the norm. I loved the paranormal aspect of the book and loved the world that Ms. Damschroder created in this trilogy. I will most definitely be reading the first two books in this trilogy and more from this author in the future.",5
B004YTMTC0,A14QJKY3DA19AP,"02 24, 2012",S. Warfield,In search of an identity,"Sonnell is a young man who is of Indian and Iranian heritage living in England.  He aspires to be a writer, but can't get past the first sentence of his short story, and that took him weeks to develop.  More than his story, he can't come up with his own identity, and at one point in this very well-written novella by A.S. Anand, Sonnell says that he isn't Indian, he isn't British and he isn't Iranian, so he doesn't fit in anywhere.  This is a problem that many people in today's world have, moving around in a global society and settling in places from which they are not.  A person in the news recently said that Mexican-Americans have the problem of being too Mexican to be American and too American to be Mexican.  This is a very sad and tragic diasporic outcome that takes hold in many lives in the world today.Sonnell takes two of his friends with him from London to Mumbai and to Goa.  Sonnell drinks his way through most of his partying, at home and away, but keeps his writing aspirations well at bay by putting things off until another day that never seems to come.  His two friends, however, are encouraging and stick by him in all his youthful foolishness that he gets himself into.  Sonnell is a very likeable character and rides along on the tide of this novella to find who he is and what he needs to do.This is not a novella full of exciting passages and an intricate plot.  It flows along as Sonnell flows through his young life with the reader by his side.  Since it is semi-autobiographical, the reader knows that the author is aware first-hand about some of these experiences that Sonnell goes through.  This is a leisurely read.  The ending left me with a feeling of being cut off from what eventually happens to Sonnell, and that was the only thing about ""Camel on an Ashtray"" that I didn't like.I recommend this as a very good novella that provides the reader with a good taste of literary writing from this author.",5

He worked for years as a corporate Technical Manager before opening a training school emphasizing Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office and it was in that role that he caught the bug for one-on-one training that eventually developed into his successful series of books on the various aspects of Excel. Bitten by the written word he now writes novels as well as training manuals for personal development.In GOAL SETTNG FOR SUCCESS (Book 1 in his Personal Devlopment series) he keeps the written portion short (though the thought aspect lingers for a long time). He opens his book with some success stories of very famous people who started with little and became notable: Lincoln, Einstein, Disney, Cher etc. and from there he addresses the importance of following dreams and setting goals to achieve those dreams. He divides his book into sections: Life Areas, Goal Requirements, Write your Goal(s) Down, Questions to help you set goals, Questions to help you achieve goals, Pleasure and Pain, and S*** happens. Each section is explored with excellent examples of the point being made.By the end of the book de Jong summarizes his teaching as follows: Decide for which area of your life you want to set a goal, Brainstorm and design your goal to meet all the requirements of a well-structured goal, Make sure your goal inspires you, Write your goal down, Read your goal every day - use emotion and be inspired!, Break your goal down into smaller chunks, or milestones with timelines, Monitor your milestones, Celebrate when you reach your milestones, Take the actions required to get the job done, Don't take on more than what you can comfortably handle, When s*** happens (and it will), first get your life back on track.You may have read all of this before, but it is the manner in which de Jong infuses energy and spirit into the process that makes it count!

You won&#8217;t be disappointed!!!!,"What happens when a girl grows up with no father and literally a highly sought after escort (whore) for a mother? You would be amazed if she ended up anything other than a whore herself, right? Well, for Emerald Anderson she didn&#8217;t know any different. The men would tell her, &#8220;Your mom is really something special.&#8221; And she believed it too.Emerald and her mom, Leah Belle because she wasn&#8217;t allowed to call her mom, had their great mother/daughter fun times. Well, if you count drinking together, smoking together, doing drugs together and telling her crazy things about sex then it was just wonderful happy times. Emerald didn&#8217;t know any better. They rarely had money to go out and she didn&#8217;t have any friends because she was told they would all betray her. That friends were considered &#8220;sponsors&#8221; to get things from. Leah Belle was all she had in the world, literally.Then she&#8217;s gone. Just like that Emerald is completely alone in the world. But turns out she has some pretty amazing grandparents that take her in. This is an entirely different world full of &#8220;normal&#8221; family time of eating together and playing games. She gets job after job not able to keep one since she&#8217;s so messed up. However, it does seem like she should be more disturbed. I found her amazing in being able to deal with things she&#8217;s been handed.She slowly realizes that her mom was wrong about everything. The drinking was a terrible idea. Some friends really can be friends. Family is important. Men are not all the same and some can be nice. Falling in love can be wonderful! Her journey in finding out pieces of this is amazing. The writing is wonderful and the characters are genuine and loving.She makes a friend, Sarah, who she thinks is a &#8220;sponsor&#8221; but starts thinking maybe she can actually have friends. She meets him, Carter. Good looking and doesn&#8217;t want to only get into her pants. He takes her on a date and enjoys spending time with her. It&#8217;s weird to Emerald &#8211; she&#8217;s never had that before. Can she allow him to care for her? Will she learn to care for him? Will she forget everything her mom ever told her and learn that not everyone will hurt her?Emerald is very wise for her age and if you consider the things she&#8217;s seen in her short life so far&#8230;.she is nothing short of amazing! I love this character. She has so much depth and heart but it&#8217;s hard to see that at first. The way the story builds and carries you away &#8211; allowing you to watch Emerald find piece after piece of herself is really fantastic writing.I found this book to be many different things. Disturbing, Hard & Sad. However, it&#8217;s also about Love, Friendship and Forgiveness. It&#8217;s emotional and uplifting almost at the same time. I HIGHLY recommend Beautiful Failure!!! I can&#8217;t wait for the 2nd book, Beautiful Temptation. There is a small cliffhanger but nothing that isn&#8217;t normal for a series book. Read this book!!!! You won&#8217;t be disappointed!!!",5
B00HUHVWZS,AG7ZPVWR3W5DH,"07 17, 2014",Diana L,"Put this author on your ""Must Read"" list- STELLAR Read","I&#8217;ve read numerous apocalypse themed books- and they&#8217;ve all been good to excellent.  Lynn Lamb knocks the ball clean out of the park with her debut book.Simply put- Stellar read.I was impressed all the way through.  There was never a lag.  The characters were extremely well crafted &#8211; although I wanted to bonk Colonel Jackson on the head a couple times or at least give him a sharp elbow to the ribs.Colonel Jackson, like all the other characters were all very real.  Perhaps it is Ms. Lamb&#8217;s filmmaker background that gives her such a special eye for even the tiniest details.Our main character, Laura, was quite the trooper.  The story was delivered to us via Laura and she delivered it with wisdom, kindness and reality.  There were lessons to be learned about people, living and life- apocalypse or not- those lessons were nicely woven into the story.Even if you, the reader, are not in to apocalypse themed stories- this is a story about people and finding out who you really are.  It isn&#8217;t &#8220;just&#8221; an apocalypse story.  The author captures so much more in this story and I think that is what really elevates the read in my eyes.I would love to give tons of details but I refuse to give you even one more as I know I would lead into spoilers and I don&#8217;t want that to occur.If there was a button to pre-order Book 2 I would have already hit it.Lynn Lamb &#8211; I see a solid writing path ahead for you and I&#8217;m glad we crossed paths.Highly recommend this read.",5

An abused woman such as Erin.... would have stayed far away from Nate.... NO matter how hot he was... She was ""burned"" once. I did love his cocky character.. but.... She wouldn't have anything to do with a walking STD. I am just saying that I really did enjoy this book.. But a more realistic version would have been him having to work a little harder at not being a bully to win her over. And she would have definitely been offended about the furniture. It would have made her look exactly like what her ex called her if she accepted it. Yes, I read the second one, too.. and liked it also.",5

B00AXDNVHS,A12ILKN4OMSPBM,"02 23, 2013",Ash Wednesday Lee,Get Your Patronus Ready,"I usually try to review a book immediately after finishing it, in the hopes of capturing how I exactly feel at that moment. But this one, I had to give pause.I wasn't sure what to expect with that blurb but it's such a disservice to the great work put in to writing here that it only has 59 ratings and 31 reviews. It's going to be a b*tch to write but I'll try to bridge my thoughts into coherence.This is not a conventional romance. The heroine has to rescue the hero, no 'I love you's were exchanged (I checked), there's no badly skewed love triangle plot device and there is no big misunderstanding and bigger reunion in the end.This is not an erotic novel. There is BDSM but there are no doms, no subs and no safewords.It is, for all intents and purposes, a horror story and a fairytale.This is the story of Finn Strachan, a man trapped in a castle by the evil Lady Blaine Albermarle and Lilith Bresson, a notoriously popular artist who came to settle her father's debt with the mysterious Lady. Why yes, that sounds an awful like Disney's Beauty and the Beast, with the talking teacups and candelabra and in certain aspects it felt like a contemporary retelling of that &#34;tale as old as time&#34;(TM).Which makes this plot difficult to pull off, because at this day and age of overshare, can one person really be held a prisoner and be subjected to such acts of pure, unadulterated evil? There are too many options out there to convince me the 'no other way' logic for Finn and even Henry. However, I did get over it, (I've suspended belief until the dinner scene with the TV director) because Tabitha McGowan tells a story that puts man's depravity in all its grotesque glory and it kind of makes nitpicking and breathing while reading this too difficult.To put things in perspective, compared to Finn, Caleb from The Dark Duet got into boarding school and goes to the Bahamas during the semester breaks.They say the greatest evil is apathy, but evil is evil. Putting it in a spectrum is almost as offensive as the act: lesser evils don't make them less horrible when you're staring at it in the eye. What went on in that castle, will challenge anyone with a beating heart. It did sometimes feel like 'shock selling' and the &#34;near-gratuitous violence&#34; will probably put off a lot of the readers. I wish it won't but it will. I did nearly write it off as too much for one heart but I did recognize the impeccable writing, the obscene humor that carried the story on, the endearing and the horrid secondary characters and I was truly rewarded by something more than a story of a man being rescued by the girl of his dreams.I wouldn't have survived this read if not for moments like:&#8220;She wore a cantilevered , augmented-breast-skimming satin dress the colour of egg-yolk. Somewhere in deepest Nebraska, a prom queen two sizes smaller than Selena was wondering where the f*** her outfit had disappeared to.&#34;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what the hell to say to that. I just gave an ungrateful sigh of exasperation and pulled the sweater over my head.&#8216;It&#8217;s just your colour,&#8217; Henry enthused.&#8216;And you can f*** right off,&#8217; I said.&#34;So grow a pair, put on those big girl pants and give this book the chance it deserves.-------",5

B007QUU9JO,A2JMLAUQPLGG11,"01 3, 2013",Olimpia A. Padula,Night's Darkest Embrace,"An awesome new novella that Jeaniene Frost has brought us.  Very different from her Night Huntress series.  So if you are looking for Bones and Cat.  They aren't in this.  BUT it does have the same style writing and lots of new characters.  Night's Darkest Embrace is about demons both purebloods and partials, and fallen angels.  Their world is another realm called Nocturna.The two main characters, Raphael and Mara are perfect for each other.  They are both very strong characters and even though their relationship starts off rocky, they learn to trust each other and work with each other.This novella had so much action, and twists and turns that keep you wanting to read.

As soon as I read the blurb for these book I was sold. My two favorite things in one book - superheroes and romance - uh YES PLEASE! Dodge had me at hello, I write superhero novels *sigh* and what a novel it is. I think my only grump about this book is that it's too short. I've come to realize I'm greedy with books, if I love it I want MORE MORE MORE MORE. Temptress is no exception. Jenny is a wonderful female lead who puts the rights of others before herself - a true superhero even without the powers. But once you add in the powers she is a hero who isn't out for the glory and would much rather spend her time in front of the television in sweats (honey, wouldn't we all?). I love how she is willing to kick ass at a moments notice but isn't superior or mighty about it, she's totally down to earth. Treating superhero life like a normal job and being happy to make a difference where she can.Enter Thinktank. Ooooooh honey. I see him as a kind of Professor X meets Wolverine. The brawn AND the brains. Hot combo because obviously women love men that can think and rip our clothes off - duh. Thinktank trips into Jenny/Temptresses life by accident and ends up following her around due to power complications. Funnily, Jenny has a reputation as a take no prisoners, more likely to kill you than hug you super. So Tanky believes himself up to be in major trouble. Yet the more time Thinktank spends with Jenny, the more he realizes that she isn't as horrible as everyone's made out and may in fact be the sweetest, kick-ass lady he's met. Their budding relationship made me so comfy and happy I wanted to curl up in a ball and purr. I love sweet romances interlaced with a couple rockin' battles and Lola Dodge delivers one of the best. I love this book so much! I only wish it could be longer so the end didn't arrive so fast. The Manhattan Ten is a series jumping onto my favorites shelf for sure!",5

It was a super power indeed, her stories have been read by millions.

B00AA4JIWC,A34PUA9NURI5T,"12 26, 2013",Cymberle,Dark and Wonderful - Love it!,"I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest reviewAuthor Cameron Jace has a new fan. His books have been on my TBR list for a while, and I'm so glad I had the chance to read The Grimm Diaries Prequels 1-6. Now I really want to read everything he's written! I'm a huge fairy tale fan, and I love stories that twist the tales or offer new insights into the characters. These prequels were so intriguing, I can't wait to read more. I'm taking his new novel Insanity with me on my trip next week, so expect a review the week of January 6.We are treated to six prequels, tasty glimpses into what The Grimm Diaries have to offer. These are stories you have to experience for yourself, and seeing that it's free right now on Amazon, there's no excuse not to download  these prequels. Go ahead, I'll wait...The prequels are compelling, well-written, and impossible to put down. I love the vivid imagery, in the prequel to Ashes to Ashes, I swear I could almost smell the multiple fires. The prequel for Snow White Blood Red totally threw me for a loop. What an amazing twist on the fairy tale - I absolutely loved it! So I could continue to wax philosophical on why these books have made my favorite list, but that just takes away from reading time.I highly recommend The Grimm Diaries Prequels 1-6 to everyone high school and up. If you love fairy tales, look no further. Just be warned, these are dark tales, darker than even the Brothers Grimm imagined at times. Be prepared for graphic violence, blood, death, and torture. But if you've read the original Brothers Grimm tales, then you already know that everything is not always sunshine and lollipops. Behind that candy lure lurks evil just waiting for an unsuspecting victim.You can find this review and many more at [...]",5

B00AR7UYU2,A1UFU1Q1KSSWIY,"03 5, 2013",The Kindle Book Review,The Girl in the Window - More than just a romance,"I was given the pleasure of reviewing The Girl in the Window by Valerie Douglas.  It's a romance--but so much more.When a book grabs me and characters stay with me, I know I've found a book to add to the keeper shelf. The Girl in the Window is the story of Beth and Josh. But it's so much more than that. This story is about overcoming a troubled past. It's about surviving to beat the odds--it's about love and forgiveness. It's about determination.I really enjoyed the parallels between the female protagonist, Beth, and the horse, Fair, that belonged to the male lead, Josh. It's obvious early on that Fair has been mistreated somehow--and Beth is the only one that can get near him.Both were troubled--and Josh could tell--as he'd watched her through her window.  He'd purchased Fair in the hopes that the nearly-wild horse could be trained to run in races. Everyone said it wouldn't and couldn't happen. Months of work had accomplished little--until Beth. It seemed as if Beth was the key -- almost as if the horse could relate to a kindred soul.Josh had watched Beth interact with the horse with amazement--and knew he wanted know her, and then he just plain wanted her. When they finally meet, she isn't sure if he wants more than she's able to give.The secondary characters added flavor to the story and were interesting as well. It's easy to give this book five stars.The only issue I had at all is that I'd have liked to see just a bit more of Josh and Beth together--but I was done the book before I even realized that the story flowed so well, I'd reached 'the end' before it dawned on me that this book isn't really your typical romance at all. It's more a journey for all the characters involved--both human and equine.In parts it had me near tears. Other parts had me smiling. But every page had me turning it to see what was next in their journey.Ms. Douglas brings her story together in such a way that it's impossible to sit down. I read it in one sitting (hey, who needs sleep?) and will likely read it again.Kudos, Ms. Douglas. I'll be looking at more of your work.I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review via The Kindle Review.Hope Welsh, The Kindle Review Team",5
B00D5YWZFQ,A2I9SOM8NW320O,"07 19, 2014",Michelle New,Another great installment in a brilliant series by the master of alpha males.,"For nine years, Jacob &#8216;Deck&#8217; Decker has let the beauty escape him. But when he hears a familiar voice from his past, all the time he&#8217;s lost rushes into his thoughts and he isn&#8217;t about to let that kind of beauty slip through his fingers again.Deck never thought he would see Emme again after he shut the door in her face all those years ago, but when he&#8217;s brought on to help an investigation in Gnaw Bone, he&#8217;s seeing things for the first time that his heart never before revealed.Emme has changed, she&#8217;s still the same smart and friendly girl that Deck remembers spending all that time with, but her beauty is surprising. Always a bit hidden behind a mask of simple and plain, Emme has grown into a woman. For years Deck longed for the love of the wrong woman, not realizing that what he needed was the best friend of the woman that broke his heart.&#8221;You think you lost beauty, Jacob, but you didn't. Just turn the dial.&#8221;Deck&#8217;s brought in to the fold when another crime spree takes hold of the quaint mountain town, but when he sees the suspects he knows there is no way he will turn down helping the local authorities. He knows the face of the woman on that board, a woman that could never be capable of what she&#8217;s suspected of. Clearing her name is his first priority, getting her into his bed is his second.In the days after seeing each other for the first time, Emme can&#8217;t seem to stay away from Deck; dinners, phone calls&#8230; but the only problem is that Emme has a man in her life. A man that came to be after she realizes just how alone she is, a man that she doesn't want to commit to. Deck&#8217;s return is everything that she&#8217;s always wanted but never could have. Deck isn't going to waste any time making her realize that he&#8217;s the only man for her.&#8221;This was a kaleidoscope of beauty, the dials spinning, ever changing, but never anything short of spectacular.&#8221;There is just some things you are guaranteed when you dive into a Kristen Ashley book. Sure you get the alpha male, the bit of suspense/drama, bad-a men who may or may not be on the right side of the law; but you get something even more spectacular. You get a story that gives you a complete escape from reality. The type of story that has you swooning and wanting a man to come sweep you off your feet, while tossing you over his shoulder and carrying you away. There is just something flawless about the heroes she creates while ensuring that you get the perfect heroines.KA does it again, Deck might just be my favorite of all the CM men. It didn't have all the action that the prior ones held, but it was packed full of sweet; making it one of my favorites of the series. Deck, like the other ultra-alphas isn't going to take no for an answer, he knows that if he doesn't push Emme that she will allow the trauma of her past take away the possibility to be happy, to be with the man she loves. There was just something about him that was perfectThese two share such a beautiful story that started off as friendship, but everyone else could see that there was so much more beneath the surface. Deck&#8217;s character was absolutely fantastic. Down to the way he treated, handled and loved Emme, to his deep friendship with Chace. Emme was such a lovable character, instantly charmed by her. Usually the insecure type heroines can be a bit much to take, but there was something about Emme and the reasons for her actions that makes you love her even more.",5

Curnutt ""Pastor Dan""",Epic Saga of coming of Age in the Troubled South during the 50's and 60's,"Ron Argo gives us a flowing epic story of a young teenager who starts his summer vacation with a friend just wondering through the woods when they happen upon a lynching of a black man by the KKK.  This event will be seared into his mind and cause him to run from certain people, certain events and certain situations for a long time.But as summer wears on he finds a girlfriend, OK two girlfriends, no one said he was smart.  He has a falling out with both as they discover each other and he is left to start school that fall on his own and trying to avoid some of the teens that had been involved with the adults with the lynching.He meets Joe, a new dentist to town who is young, handsome, talented and for whatever reason takes a shine to a 15 year old teenager who is from a very poor family.The rest of the story will revolve around Sonny and his relationship with Joe.  It will delve into the details of Civil Rights, Teen angst over sexual conquests, Government intrusion and how War can come to destroy just about everything.It is a good saga. It is long and may seem a bit tedious at times, but stick with it as the flow comes back around and you will see the need for each of the sections as you get to the end of the story.Ron Argo is probably writing a lot from the heart and from his own experience.  As such the story is believable and honest and touching.Enjoy!",5

B00L19CQPG,A3O2UZACDPCGZ5,"06 28, 2014",Alan Arthur Katz,They Just Don't Get Better Than This!,"I can't remember the last time (if ever) I got to the end of a book with tears streaming down my face, laughing hysterically.This is, without a doubt, one of the best books I've ever read. Creative, inventive, touching, even scary at moments, it is the work of a true master at both the craft and art of writing.Most of the characters are inherited from the previous book, including the main character,  Tyson (The Kid), an incredibly smart, precocious young fellow who is as broken as he is brilliant. Ty and his his brother, Derrick (Bear), were abandoned by their mother when Ty was only five. Bear raised him, being father, friend and brother to Ty. He is the only one who could get him through the panic attacks that have ruled his life, holding him and exhorting him to ""breathe... hold, two...hold,...three...hold, breathe"". He pretty much gave up his life to support and protect The Kid and, along the way, married the love of his life, Oliver (Otter).Ty has only one friend in the world, an overgrown boy, some years older than him, whom he befriended when he was assiduously tracking an ant on the sidewalk. The two became inseparable, and Dominic (Dom) became part of his family. Dominic was damaged, too, which is likely why the two felt such an immediate bond. When Dominic was just a kid, his father attacked his mother, in front of him, and though he stabbed him seven times to protect her, he was too late to save her. He never got over that and spent the rest of his youth bouncing around the Foster Care system.Although Dominic was huge and strong, he was shy and withdrawn. Only Ty brought him out of his shell. Their love never went beyond friendship, if for no other reason, the age difference between them would have made a more intimate relationship out of the question.At the age of 15, Ty is accepted at Dartmouth and has to leave Seafare, Oregon, his home, and move to New Hampshire to attend school. Of course, this rips the two best friends apart. Even worse, Ty sees Dom kissing a woman and, literally, flips out, hiding in a bathtub and unable to breathe. Now he knows that the boy he loves more than anyone with the exception of his brother, Bear, is not available, and never will be.For the next four years, Ty will neither accept calls nor visits from Dom - and he is falling apart. The main plot of the book is the journey of these two wonderful, but damaged men, back to each other.""The Art Of Breathing"" is a complex book with a host of subplots and secondary characters, every one of them well-developed, unique, eccentric and brimming with personality. Among them is Ty's bigendered Dartmouth friend, Corey (sometimes Kori) and the friends she brings into Tyson's life, including a renowned female impersonator and a whole cast of bizarre and loving people surrounding her, a long-lost sister, a horny ""straight"" college roommate who keeps trying to get Ty into bed, Dom's spouse, a team of horny frat boys playing volleyball on the beach, and the beloved Mrs. Paquinn whose voice is heard throughout the book despite the fact that she is long-departed.And speaking of voices, I don't know any contemporary author who handles dialogue as well as Mr. Klune. Not only is it believable and authentic, it's sometimes poetic and, often, totally over-the-top. In his role as protector, Bear is known to have flights of paranoia. One such amazing scenario spins out when Ty is scheduled to drive his roommate from Oregon to Tucson. Bear is terrified of the two driving, alone, 1500 miles from home. He goes into this wild riff in which he fantasies that their car breaks down in the desert, right next to a former meatpacking plant. Ty, the vegetarian animal activist would, of course, have to explore it, at which time he would be kidnapped by the serial-killing cult that inhabits the plant.... you get the drift. These excursions into fantasy are often hilarious. In fact, the book is laugh-out-loud funny in places, even as it deals with difficult and sad situations, leaving the reader confused as to whether to laugh or cry. As I mentioned earlier, I did both - often at the same time.The writing is nothing less than brilliant. I bookmarked some passages just to go back and enjoy the rhythm, metaphor, poetry and laugh-out-loud humor of some of Mr. Klune's words.One of the secondary characters, Anna, admonishes her young son, JJ:""And why don't we eat glitter and glue any more? Anna asked her son.Because you said it makes my poop look like abstract art.""Despite the humor and the incredibly interesting and attractive characters, Mr. Klune has some very serious points to make about family - and how so many traditional families fail, resulting in damaged kids. And how important it is that, today, we have the invaluable opportunity to make our own families, families built on love, not accident of birth. The whole book, in fact, is a paean to friendship, commitment and brotherhood.There is one meme that ties the whole book together - a single word that the nine-year-old Ty just learned the same day that he met Dominic - ""inevitable"". That very first day, when asked by Ty whether they would be best friends, Dom replies ""It's inevitable"". All through the book, inevitability keeps popping up to tie its many parts together. And, of course, Dom and Tyson are, indeed, inevitable.If you're looking for a first-class read with brilliant characters and equally brilliant writing, this is the book. If you're looking for a book that's profoundly beautiful, this is the book. Thank you, Mr. Klune, from the bottom of my heart.",5

Is an utterly compelling story, gorgeously written with a weird twist in the end. I was so sucked in, the time just sped by. It was captivating and very cleverly written with beautiful illustrations. This book was not what I expected but instead it was much more! It's a book for children but I enjoyed the book as an adult too. Sometimes you come across a book that's very hard to forget, a book that has a story so amazing it stays in the back of your mind wondering what if. Well, this is one of those books. Spartan and the Green Egg is a fantasy book that is pretty well thought out, all the weird technology, gadgets and alien beings are all so believable you'll be convinced it all really happened. I feel the logic and the factual information keeps the reader believing the fantasy. Another thing I really like about the book is that it has a strong positive message, great for kids to ponder about.I bought this book for my daughter. My intentions were to flip through the pages and see what it was all about. Fifteen minutes later I was still reading and enjoying the beautiful illustrations. Shortly after that I was searching the net for book 2. Not often am I so profoundly moved by a work of fiction and never before this type of fiction, the comic book type. That's why I feel I must rate this book no less than five stars. The author has done an amazing job delivering such a wonderful read. My daughter is a pretty tough one to please, but this book did it with ease. Overall, a highly recommendable purchase for fans of the genre you can't go wrong.",5

B00EHFGHVK,A328S9RN3U5M68,"09 4, 2013",Grady Harp,`Adopt to a Yoga lifestyle to live an active and purposeful life!',"Anisha Lee is a fine instructor as well as a fine writer. She opens her book with an Introduction that sets the calm and relaxed pace for the reader who want s to FINALLY begin to practice Yoga: `Yoga is the enlightened way of living - an ancient natural science which was learnt and practiced by the Yogis in India. It fuses exercise, relaxation techniques, meditation, and controlled breathing - a combination of mental and physical disciplines that's considered more than 5000 years old. It makes the mind calmer and much more controlled, and increases the body's health and strength, helping on the way towards self-realization.' With words as informed and reassuring as these the reader can feel the impulse to join the ranks of the many people who have added the practice of Yoga to their lives.While many books for beginners concentrate on postures and cerebral reasons for moving in to the realm of Yoga, Anisha Lee takes a more thorough approach. She explains that not only does Yoga to improve flexibility, strength, tone, balance and coordination, but it also leads to defined muscle tone, release of body fat, treat insomnia, hypertension, boost the immune system and enhance entry into a state of peacefulness in this chaotic world. That, she explains, is the science of Yoga.From this stance Anisha Lee provides careful informed instruction on how to approach your first Yoga experience, the items necessary to begin the practice of Yoga, when and when not to practice Yoga, settles us in to the basics of Yoga and even spends considerable time offering a rich explanation of Pranayama - the foundation of Yoga therapy, in perhaps the most accessible explanation of the field that has been written for beginners. In this section she adds photographs of the many poses and postures that make following her instructions simple.The information is all here, made of easy and gently supportive that this surely is THE beginners' book for Yoga!

Preach was a club member and a brother and Daisy was a daughter of a club member and his Old Lady who was more of a whore than an old lady and she was Jenna&#8217;s best friend.I don&#8217;t have any logical reason for loving this book and this series.  None.  I don&#8217;t have long drawn out words to say how it touched me emotionally.  I just liked it.  A lot.Do I like cheating?  No.  Do I like it when I want to reach through the book and punch our hero to make him wake up and snap out of his crap?  No.  There was a sneaky scene in this book where even Mary is in on it and I thought wow that is messed up grandma.  Do I want a man like Preach or even Kidd?  Heck no.  I still loved this freaking book though.I think there books that are just written in a way that even though you don&#8217;t like what the characters are doing, you can still have empathy and hope that things work out for them, you think so much bad crap has happened, can they not please get their HEA?  You want to see where the characters go, are they going to bottom out or is one of them going to take a gun and shoot the other one?That was Renegade Reject.  That was Renegade Lady for me.  I have a feeling that will be the whole series for me.I want more of the Renegade Sons.  I loved it.5 stars from me.Thank you so much for my copy of Renegade Reject!",5

B00KTRIIC6,A3Q0SBW6652MIG,"06 13, 2014",Eve Paludan,It's magical! New young adult paranormal witch series is charming and fun!,"Two best friends, one of whim is a teenage witch, sleuth after the killer of two girls from their high school in Salem, using magic and all-around cleverness. All MIranda has to do is tug on her earlobe and think about what she wants to do, change, or create. I was charmed by this Nancy Drew-like character and her bestie sidekick, Tina. The language is very simple, short sentences which even middle-grade readers could easily read. There is lots of dialogue to keep the story moving fast. This is very much a teen girl's kind of novel, with suspense, danger, comedy, and the kind of friendship that can launch and sustain a series. I enjoyed the magical beauty makeovers as well as the teen drama that ensues over serious things as well as the everyday teen moments. As Miranda's powers develop, her need to know who her real parents are becomes a running thread throughout the book, and looks like it will be a sustainable theme throughout the series. She's a witch, so her intense curiosity about her origins is believable and empathetic for the reader. I was charmed and enchanted as the girls follow the clues until...Good start to the series for girls and young adults! Very cute! Light reading, even though it is a murder mystery. The comedic moments lighten up the storyline. I was charmed and enchanted! - Eve Paludan",5

If you're a fan of the genre, this is a must-add to your bookshelf. If you've never tried a historical romance before, this should be the book you experiment with.The plot is simple: Ian the hero goes to London with the purpose of ruining Evangeline ""Vangie"" the heroine because he's been led to believe she caused the death of his father and brother. Not knowing there's a more sinister plot afoot that's driving his actions, he meets Vangie and hates that he's attracted to her and she's nothing like what he'd been told she was. Vangie is innocent, but not the annoying kind. Cameron does a wonderful job of creating a heroine that accurately reflects the women of the time period without driving the reader nuts. Vangie is all heart and sweetness and love but she's brave and compassionate too. I liked her right away.Ian was a loveable rogue. One of my favorite heroes in a while. I fell right into step with him as I read the story and loved reading his parts of the story from his point of view. He's charming and mischievous and yet burdened with a dark mission to make Vangie pay for sins he's been told she's committed.When the pair get compromised and are forced to marry, you can imagine the sparks that fly and the misunderstandings that the poor couple face. This is certainly a ""page-turner"" and a delightful one at that. It had equal parts humor, sweetness and spiciness and is an absolute must read for a romance fan!",5

Her characters, though supernatural, were ironically real and easy to connect with.  It was compelling and forward-moving, keeping this reader's interest at every twist and turn.  I commend Ressa Empbra for fabricating such original and refreshing characters, as well as unparalleled story lines.  Ms. Empbra makes the impossible seem possible and in an ever-increasing market for the paranormal, I see her rising to the top with her characters emerging as the next TV series/movie franchise ensemble.Iax Sarvias Eluhyax is born in the Amethyst Fairie Dragon Dimension.  Orphaned shortly after, she is brought to Earth by the Outer Worldly Operations unit of the CIA to be raised as a human, by Special Agent David Conifurr and his wife, Elise.Iax grows up to work in the same business as her father, traveling to different realms and dimensions, though never knowing when she'd leave one dimension to visit another.  Her abilities to travel through space and time are as frustrating to Iax as they are thrilling, yet her traveling companion, Gemma makes it all worth while.  Iax could not exist without her ever-proper bestie.  And though Gemma is certainly more reserved, she complements the loveable foul-mouthed Iax.  Their banter and friendship add both comedy and natural tenderness in an otherwise unnatural existence.Journeying through the Dragon Cove Realm on a mission to rescue the kidnapped, pregnant Truemate of Weyr Chief, Gordell, Iax and Gemma find themselves caught in challenging predicamints.  One of which finds Iax crazy in lust with the gorgeous dragon-shifter, Mazar.  Heavily opposed to falling in love and giving up her independence, Iax fights her growing lust when she realizes her emotions travel deeper than a superficial attraction.  Iax is falling in love...but she MUST resist.And just when Iax thinks she had seen it all, she is made aware of a secret kept from her for her entire twenty-four years.I enjoyed being caught in the Dragon Cove, as I am sure you will too.  You will be amazed at Iax's resilience to this newly uncovered secret and you will cheer with her as she fights the enemy while also slaying her own damn emotions and foul-mouth.  You will laugh, you will cry and you will love Ressa Empbra's, The Dragon Dimension - Caught in the Dragon Cove.",5

The Wager was everything that you wanted and more from Rachel, and a great continuation to the Titus story. This is the story of Jake, whom we met in The Bet, and Char- whom we also briefly met in The Bet. Jake, is the younger brother to Travis Titus- who is marrying Kacey (Jake's former girlfriend and all around best friend), and Char is Kacey's other best friend. Nothing was ever mentioned in The Bet about them having any previous history together at all, but apparently they do- and it is not the best. Apparently, they had a night of steamy passion several months prior to when the story begins (picking up soon after the end of The Bet), and just as Jake did to Kacey, he left Char high and dry promptly afterwards. But in this case, he actually was quite affected by Char, which I really think just scared the hell out of him.So, when he and Grandma run into Char at the airport on their way back to Seattle, he instantly knows that his life is about to become quite uncomfortable for a bit. Enter Grandma and all of her meddling, yet seriously freaking hilarious, ways of rearranging his life and working her matchmaking magic. Have I said yet how much I LOVE Grandma?? She is awesome!! She is most definitely the source of the humor and hilarity throughout both books. So, she begins doing what she knows best, which is bringing Jake and Char back together, being sure to make it so that they will be completely joined together- not taking any chances that all of her hard work might go to waste. I have to say, that woman is quite creative!! But of course, we have to remember that this book is titled The Wager though, which means that somewhere, somebody is bound to be doing their own form of matchmaking in addition to Grandma's. Enter Kacey and Travis, who take it upon themselves to try and fix Char up with an acquaintance of Travis's, while simultaneously betting Grandma that their coupling will be the ultimate winner. Apparently, this means war to the Titus family, because Grandma starts pulling out all the stops to get her way. And, her way gives us lots of steamy goodness for Jake and Char!! Now, aren't you glad that 86-year old bitty stuck to her guns and helped us all out?? Again, love me some Grandma!!This book definitely has its steam, not as much as some, but definitely more than others. I have noticed that all of Rachel's books that I have read so far, do tend to keep it on the lighter side of steamy, which is perfectly acceptable. I just want to make sure that everyone understands that this isn't anything too hot and heavy, and nothing too graphic. But that doesn't take away from her books-- not at all!! Some of my new faves are hers. And this one, is no different from that.5 stars!!!!",5

Eryx was becoming my new favorite book boyfriend with each passing page and I don't know if it's because he was SO amazing or because he was the God of Love, but I completely understood Maia's feelings, lol.I actually really enjoyed Maia's character as well. She was smart and strong and I love how passionate she was for her work.I really really enjoyed this book. My one small comment is even though I loved how it ended (because duh happy ending!) but I kind of wanted it to go the other way and have him stay as he was and have had Maia join him, even though it was less practical, just my thoughts as I'm reflect, but hey it was still an AMAZING ending and I loved the last sentence, it was a great, powerful way to end.

Captain Avery has plenty of redeeming qualities like kindness, compassion and integrity even though it won't admit it. He believes it can't love just one woman so he leaves her because he has a misguided notion that its for her own good. I think he was just afraid to admit he has feelings for briget.

Tina and Jamey are figuring out their new relationship and just beginning to combine their separate lives, until secrets from Janey's past come to the surface, and threaten to not just split Tina and Jamey up, but possibly endanger both their lives as well.This novel is every bit as compelling as the first book in the series; the author's prose is crisp, and she has a fantastic eye for detail, whether it's describing a dive in the beautiful waters of Hawaii, or a village in war-torn Afghanistan.  Also as in the first book, Tina is a heroine who's both believable and rootable - and also very human.Where the first novel was more of a mystery, this book delves into a war story, as well as exploring the rules of &#34;dream jumping&#34; more deeply.  The story switches back and forth between Tina's and Jamey's perspectives, and, like the first book, we meet a variety of great secondary characters (Jamey's father especially stands out, to me).All in all, this is a fun and exciting read (I bought it yesterday afternoon, and I just couldn't put it down!), and I highly recommend it.

Even though This book had these issues I still really enjoyed the book and wished it was longer. I loved the idea and story behind the hero and heroine, and all the background in this book just made me connect more with both Asher and Lilly. A lot of the books I have been reading lately I have fond myself wanting to skim or skip ahead so that I could get the book done quicker, but this one was the opposite I didn't want it to end and the higher I got in percentage the more I wanted to slow down but the story kept me from being able to slow down.When Lilly finds out her mother has cancer she leaves college and comes home. On the way home Lilly has an accident, stander with no cell phone Lilly is rescued by a MC group against her will. When the ride ends up at her moms house without giving the man her address Lilly is scared and confused. Then she finds out the man is Asher. Asher and Lilly were inseparable growing up. Lilly had it all while Asher was from the wrong side of town. Then one day her parents enrolled her in boarding school and shipped her off before she could even tell Asher goodbye. Now years later they are both very different people, but Lilly can't deny how she still feels about Asher and soon she finds herself going to him and then wrapped in Asher's dangerous world of his MC.This was a great short story, I easily fell in love not only with Asher and Lilly but also with their story. Asher was your typical strong possessive biker but he was also the boy Lilly left behind. Lilly struggled with reconciling the past Asher with the present Asher, and trying to decide if she could live without him. I din't want this book to end and when I saw it ended the way it did I was really upset then I saw that book two was out so I was good. Hopefully book two won't end on a cliffhanger, since book three has yet to be released. I also really hope this won't be to many parts. Elsa Day did a great job creating a world that easily sucked me in and kept me hooked.",5

B00BF3O2RS,A1QTTDEVDELZA8,"02 2, 2014",KMT,Loved It !,"I loved this book.  The story is short and sweet.  The characters are well developed and interesting.  The only character I didn&#8217;t like was Brent, Suzanne&#8217;s best friend and former boss.  I thought his inclusion as the voice of reason was overdone and made him look juvenile and foolish, not someone who could provide good guidance to Suzanne or could ever run a successful restaurant. Three years ago, Suzanne dumped Daryle Catterton, with no regrets.  She hasn&#8217;t really thought much about him lately, until he comes in to her Cupcakery with an unusual proposition, from which both stand to gain much. However, the devil, as usual, is in the details&#8212;and following through on them as agreed to by both.  I found the proposition that Daryle makes interesting and would definitely present a challenge for any business-oriented woman.  However, Suzanne is a strong woman and great businesswoman and makes a choice she can, she thinks, live with.  I loved the character Suzanne, because she seems very strong and oriented toward her goals.  However, at the same time, she has just the right touch of softness to makes her believable and someone after which many would aspire. Initially, Daryle is just another trust fund baby, not caring much about what happens to anyone else but himself.  However, as the story progresses, we see he has moved beyond that and becomes a fairly likable fellow, finally with his head screwed on right. This is a short book, a novella actually, but is a fantastic read. Because of its brevity, there is not a lot of drag to the story and any reader can read it in a fairly reasonable timeframe, even with a busy schedule.  I think any reader who enjoys a good romance with all its ups and downs would enjoy it.  I know I did.  I received this from Library Thing to read and review.",5

A man who captured my heart and then slowly enslaved it. And then he left me.Hope was a studious, serious girl who followed the rules and was focused on her future. She goes on a winter vacation to the Blue Ridge Mountains with her sister for a wedding. She just plans on relaxing and enjoying the snow. But that all changes when she meets Jack. And with the encouragement of her carefree sister, Hope uncharacteristically begins a fling. But it has a predetermined timeline.I absolutely loved Jack! He was genuinely sweet, sexy, and affectionate. But he was also protective and did not want to hurt Hope. And she was cute, loving and real. They were so likable and had such hot chemistry. I loved their interactions and the fact that they actually shared and talked and it was not all about the steamy sex. It was bittersweet. My heart broke for them as their time was coming to a close. And there were circumstances that were beyond their control. Jack was in the Army and he had to follow orders.""I don't want you waiting around for me. I might not come back and that's not fair to you.""I read this whole novella holding my breath. It started in present time and then told their story in flashbacks.

B00GZ6QI4A,A1X1DZCN3RS6V7,"02 7, 2014",Angellicia,Another heartbreaking installment of this series,"This is the continued story of Emily and Dexter from Take My Hand.  It picks up where the first book left off.  It's written in the same dual POV but this one seems to concentrate more on Dexter's side than Emily's which I really like.  It's something about being inside the guy's head that makes a story so much more enjoyable to me!  Nicola Haken has become one of my favorite authors as I read this series.  I love how she has the character seem as if the reader is right there beside them and they're having a conversation with you.  It helps to draw you in and you feel even more involved in the story which strengthens the bond you have with the character.  I can't recall any books that I've read that does that to the extent she does and I really enjoy it!Emily finally sticks her head out of her turtle shell and faces the fact that Dex has relapsed.  Things get a little too intense for her and she makes the hard decision to go back home without Dex because she can't sit by and watch the man she loves destroy himself.  Instead of doing she and the reader hopes and snapping out of it to follow her, Dex spirals even deeper into his own private hell.  Emily's brother, Chris, plays a bigger role in this book which I felt was good because Emily needed a family member there to help her since Rachel is pretty much non-existent in this installment.The jerkwad sperm donor follows through with his demand of wanting the house, so Aunt Sarah and Dex find themselves homeless.  Sarah gets a job and moves into a crap apartment and Dex spends most of his time on the streets, where he eventually overdoses.This book has a couple of truly heartbreaking scenes as well as detailed drug usage.  My heart broke for Dex as he finds himself having to face his demons head on to try and save himself and his relationship.The surprise in this book for me, though, came not from one of the main characters, but a supporting one.  It was a welcome surprise though and I'm really glad Nicola wrote it the way she did.You find yourself still pulling for this couple who have had themselves broken and worn down, hoping they'll find they way back to each other.  Depending on how you view it, it's either a good thing or a bad thing, but Emily and Dexter's story still isn't to it's finish.  I foresee a devastating event happening and I worry how it will affect everyone.The next book in the series is Rachel and Jared's story, so we have to wait for book 4 to see how this love story ends.  That's my only complaint about Hold On Tight is having to wait for the release of Never Let Go!",5

It is written in the present tense, which is very very irritating.  I almost returned it because of this.  But because I love the ""Alien world needs women and kidnaps earth women"" plot so much, I had to force myself to read it.  I am so glad that I did because it was truly a wonderful book.  Yes there were typos, and yes the tense made it hard for me to adjust to.  But it was such a great story that I couldn't give it anything less than a 5.The world the author created was fabulous.  I loved the aliens, their looks, and their customs.  Grim was a fantastic hero.  He was strong, caring, protective, flawed, and simply amazing.  Lisa was a wonderful heroine.  I never had a moment where I was irritated with her in any way.  I was so impressed with how she handled the men and carved out a life SHE could be happy with in her new world.  She dragged everyone with her and didn't buckle under the expectations of the alien culture.  The love and relationship between the h/H was wonderful and sweet.  They truly supported and respected each other.On a side note. I have to say I kept hoping and praying, and eagerly anticipating Lisa giving Grim a taste of oral sex, because that would have just blown his mind, and been a wonderful scene, as it is something that one of their females NEVER would have done.  Alas I was disappointed. :(  But there is always the next book??? :)I loved the politics of the society and the mystery.  It was just a wonderful wonderful book.

If you enjoy complex detail filled sci-fi adventures this should be on your list of future reads. Read on to see why I like what this author is creating.The author starts with a narrative about the end of the 1,000 year Milgari war and the preparation for celebration on the Grid. Things were winding down, Defiant was going home, and I was expecting a rather slow and relaxing read offering lots of reflection and insight into the main characters.  But when Grange and his team detected some inconsistencies in President McKinzey&#8217;s speech and no mention about the Nation of Defiant things soon took a turn for the worst. The fight was not over; it was now a battle from within.The author immediately unfolded the story in an unexpected and exciting direction with a finely balanced blend of human angst, in your face hand-to-hand fighting, lots of blood, guts and carnage, new weaponry and some very creative technologies including the use of wormhole portals. Throughout the rollercoaster ride the plot had multiple branching opportunities that could have provided an equally viable and believable outcome. I felt that the author had ratcheted up his story telling from his earlier works making the read more engaging and enjoyable; better dialog, more descriptive directions and lots and lots of technology details. Grange not only had to defend himself from the enemy but also from his own Sergeant Frost, who took every opportunity to grope and spoil him with unwanted sexual advances in the heat of the battles. I found myself rooting for Grange and his team, laughing at Frost, and feeling sorry for the Dakari Feta Lunge.With so much information and action happening in short periods of time I found that I was going back a page or two to make sure I kept the details straight and the writer honest. I was checking the author&#8217;s math just to make sure it was accurate and came away satisfied. As a Sci-fi reader it&#8217;s the details that sell me on the story. It has to be creative and inventive but most importantly it has to be believable. Even in the end the author allowed things to go wrong as if beyond his control. It could have been easy to be predictable, but then the story itself would not be as entertaining to read. I applaud the author for taking chances on each book, not providing a predictable story ending that guarantees a sequel.  I want to be shocked and mad when the series comes to a conclusion instead of counting down to the final act. I am hooked and looking forward to the next installment of the AMP series.",5

B00GDU3OP4,ADJ4R0VWHIKT,"01 24, 2014",Sorcha O'Dowd,"A Stunning, Emotional, Rollercoaster of a Journey!","I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.As a Psychology graduate, the mention of emotional, psychological issues in the blurbs of a book always draws me in. I love real characters with real emotions and feelings, and I need them to have these basic human traits to connect with them as real people rather than as a character I&#8217;m just following for the sake of the story.Rachel&#8217;s character was one that I connected with immediately. Her deep desire to face her demons, yet the debilitating fear that makes it more difficult to do showed her to be just like any other young girl who was struggling with psychological disorders, or overwhelming emotion. I adored her for the strength she drew from sources very different to many other young people. All too often I read about young people turning to alcohol and sex to dull their emotions and feel safe, but I really admired her for the more healthy way that she dealt with her issues. Even though her &#8216;angel&#8217; (the yummy Eaden) did actually exist, I really liked how her therapist explains to her that her vision of this guardian angel was not crazy, but a natural and healthy way to feel safe in a world that she struggled with. I think that&#8217;s why I loved so much when she met Eaden and listened to his story, and his explanation of what he was, with an open and honest mind.The way that the relationship between Eaden and Rachel developed was done beautifully. I loved seeing her flashbacks to how he had helped her in the past, which had me thinking back to my own past and of the people who helped me when I was in need. Throughout &#8216;Unbound&#8217; Georgia Bell has this breathtaking ability to make you question what is actually possible in life. I was thinking about whether or not I would have somebody watching over me as I grew up to make sure I was safe, and I enjoyed this wonderful sense of peace, both Rachel&#8217;s and my own.The mystical scenes were written to perfection. I adored the way that myths and legends were entwined so closely with the real world and how we saw some familiar legendary faces only in different forms, which brings the realisation that myths and legends have been tweaked so much through the years that even famous people and places are very different to what they would have originally been.Unbound just blew me away with its absolutely stunning storyline. I was expecting a Vampire Story from the blurb, but what I actually got was so much more original and exciting than any Vampire book I have read in a very long time. Unbound was unique in its vision of immortality and with its intriguing explanation of the genetics involved in immortality, I just jumped up and down in delight at the realistic explanation to how somebody could live forever. I need this realism in fantasy to stay grounded and to find the story relatable, and my word does Georgia Bell deliver a cracker of a story that had me drawn in until the last page. I had no idea how the story would end with all the twists and turns the characters took, and just had to get to the end to know what happened.&#8216;Unbound&#8217; was a real stunning emotional rollercoaster of a journey that had me gripped throughout. 5 Stars and a definite recommended read!ARC kindly provided by the author through Xpresso Book Tours.",5

Mattingly-Woods ""KittyWoods88""",True Love and Fate,"I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.I chose 3 books from this set to review.Charming the Alpha by Liliana Rhodes:Love is complicated. Throw in some spirits, a curse and a Juliet/Romeo style romance and you have a wild read. The relationships were fluid and changing. There were a number of twists along the way with multiple HEA at the end.Protecting the Pack by Tabitha Conall:A wolf walks into the bar...hehehe. There is a lot of confusion going on and it was the perfect time to strike. Protecting the Pack is the story of a broken hero, tired from the army; the alpha, who's pack is being attacked from within; and a battered heroine, who is being used as a pawn. Insidious plan foiled by fated mates.The Alpha Claims A Mate by Georgette St. Clair:Snubbing the alpha is not a good idea. But that is what our curvy heroine does while she's having girls night out. An investigation forces them to work together, helping them to patch up first impressions. I didn't like the twist at the end. It made me angry and sad. I was glad when they ripped him apart.",5

Linda is a school teacher, Karen is the owner of a martial arts business and Anna is a soon-to-be divorced mother of two.  Each of the friends is struggling with their love lives.  The ghost hunting weekends are adventures which allow them to forget the drama in their everyday lives for a while.  The characters were realistic and easy to like and I enjoyed the storyline.

B00H6PGG9Q,AR9K6O9JFJ2JG,"02 20, 2014","Joleen ""Daughter of the King""",Helpful ghosts/lighthouse deaths,"Read in January, 2014This book caught my attention even though it's different from stories I usually read. I'm not into ghost stories, but if one just looks at this as a fantasy rather than reality, it is truly entertaining.Two sets of teenage sweethearts 80 years apart are brought together through events at this lighthouse on the Oregon coast. Ghosts of two women who died there seem to appear to people at the lighthouse, warning of danger, or in a couple of cases their appearance is to help someone in the lighthouse, in these cases, they appear to relatives..The romances are sweet, the kids are very likable and the stories are very good. Very good. They kept me up well into the night.My only recommendation to the reader would be to read all even-numbered story chapters first, then the odd numbered ones until about chapters 25 or 26. Every chapter switches from 1930s to present day, so it gets confusing. I found I wanted to read the chapters about the kids from the 30's all first, then all the present day ones. It flowed much better that way. Then of course they come together as you near the final chapters.Good read, but not what I'd call a ""guy book"", although some men might enjoy it.

It was a hard book to put down.This world is an alternative one where bots have evolved and computers have not. Desmond has lost his hand in an accident. He is a bitter frightened man. The voyage that Desmond embarks on is what is the backbone of the story, but the meat of the story is how he has been enabled since his injury. He is enabled by his ex Jim, and the disability system. Des is forced into participating in a group for those missing limbs, the &#34;Gimp Group&#34; as he calls it. Life takes a drastic turn when Des meets Corey, a young man that is able to work his prosthetic with amazing agility. What Des finds in Corey besides a new romantic relationship, is a young man that does not buy into his cavalier attitude toward his disability and others in general.Desmond's journey is often painful, sometimes depressing, but in the end life affirming. If you want to read a book that has substance, that shows how damaging enabling can be, then read it.

B006ZCUO3K,AAZW6X6EW3W4U,"04 27, 2012",Saved,The Haunting of a Southern Family: Ghosts Haunted By Ghosts,"Sometimes the line between poetry and prose is thin. In the case of BANYAN, a novella by Cynthia A. Williams, it is gossamer.BANYAN is a story about loss. It is about a family fatally flawed. It is the story of suffocating minds gone feral, of ghosts who are themselves haunted.The setting is the Cuvier family home, not unlike the Burroughs House in Ft. Myers. The time of the novel is elastic, moving back and forth through the lumberyard of the author's imagination, pirouetting around the year 1905 and what turns out to be the great tragic event of the family. Family members stay inside the house most of the time, out of touch, suffocating. Family ghosts persist, drunk with madness, unsure of their identity, haunting the house just as they are themselves haunted.In the second part of the novella, it is some fifty years later. Mrs. Dulcet conducts tours of the Cuvier home, now a national landmark and open to the public. A visitor thinks she sees a face in an upper-story window and Mrs. Dulcet, ever comfortable in her shoes, helps to disabuse visitors and readers alike of their preconceptions.A tour de force in the Southern literary tradition, BANYAN haunts the reader with its beauty, with the rich flow of the author's stream of consciousness, not unlike the growth of a Banyan tree. At the heart of BANYAN is poetic meaning incapable of distillation.I highly recommend reading the book at least once. I loved the Southern gothic feel of this novel, its creation of mood and the description of haunting and was shocked when the final mystery was revealed. Most of all, I loved the hurricane scene, a masterful piece of writing. I loved the character of Mrs. Dulcet. And I will always wonder who Bear is.",5

It&#8217;s just another piece to the history of Nora before the Red Years of the OS series.You don&#8217;t get any action regarding the assailant that attacked a former Dominatrix of Kingsley&#8217;s.

Carmen is a lost bad girl looking to getting out of town and move to Hollywood. Her saving grace while stuck in South Dakota is Walker the town hero and football star. Carmen leaves the day of their high school graduation and breaks Walker&#8217;s heart. The next seven years is a hard time for Carmen and a life changing event sends her running home and back to Walker. While this plot and storyline has been done A LOT in many books, T.A does this common storyline in a very refreshing and different way and makes it unique. Running home was not like any other books I have read with similar plots. While reading this book I loved Carmen and hated her; she broke my heart and mended it back together. So many emotions were present in this book and I felt them along with the main characters. Walker, well he is an amazing sweetheart and I want a Walker in my life. ONE WORD AND THAT IS WAYLON!!! I am jealous that I will never have a Waylon and his love. I enjoyed this book, it took me about 4 hours to read and was well written with decent editing. I was hooked by the end of the first chapter and didn&#8217;t want to put it down. A small thing that T.A did different in this book was get rid of the chapter headings and used songs instead. I love this idea, I knew the tone of what I was about to read by the song choice. I look forward from more books by T.A Hardenbrook and I will be buying and enjoying her next book Hot Southern Mess.",5

B005CYYCBM,A38SK72V6NORUP,"02 25, 2014",ReaderHal,A Lot To Like,"As far as I've seen, this is the best of the ninety-nine cent ASV bibles.  Uses the name ""Jehovah"" for the tetragrammaton, which I really like despite the fact that such would not have been the Jewish pronunciation, which isn't certainly known.  Some people mistakenly identify this version as a Watchtower publication because of the use of ""Jehovah.""  However, the bible associated with that group is the New World Translation, not the ASV.  The ASV, is a revision of the KJV published in 1901, and is associated with the English RV of 1885.  The ASV is said by many seminarians to be as literally faithful to the original languages (Greek, Hebrew) as a version of the English bible gets.  The highly respected NASB is a revision of the ASV.  I have two ASV print bibles;  it is an excellent version for study.  Still includes some archaic language - ie, thee's and thou's - but some of us like that anyway.Navigation of this Kindle edition is good, better than average.  I use an older pre-Fire Kindle, and I noticed that another reviewer who also uses an older Kindle praised the search function for direct verse look-up.  However, even though I've had mine loaded for a day, I still get a message claiming that indexing is not complete when I attempt to use the feature.  Fortunately, the well-designed Table of Contents functions very well.  I'm still holding out hope of the search feature becoming operable.The text is laid out so cleanly that reading is an easy joy.  Each verse has a faint-script Book-chapter notation at the far left so you always know ""where you are"" and each verse is left-justified, with spaces between each verse, too.  Very nice-looking, uncluttered presentation.  As a bonus the L/R buttons of your five-way navigation control takes you to the beginning of the previous or next chapter - a feature I always hope for with these inexpensive selections.  Nice.Each new chapter begins at the top of a page, and I love, love, love that feature - especially for using bookmarks.  As I say, there is a lot to like about this ASV - some bibles offered at a higher price aren't designed this well.  To conclude, I'd give this a perfect 5 stars if my direct verse feature were functional, and if it possibly becomes so after some further indexing, then I will come back and raise the rating from a strong 4-star to a 5-star, which will serve to indicate the feature did become operational.  [UPDATE:  Turns out the problem with the search feature is due to my having an older Kindle - since it wasn't a fault of this bible, I went ahead and upped the rating.  Should work fine for you folks with newer devices, while still remaining exceptional even for my old one.]Great version of the bible with well-implemented navigational features and thoughtful design for a clean visual text appearance at the cheap-seat price.  Good buy, highly recommended.",5
B00IYIBMAW,A2QQDB2DA8E723,"04 23, 2014","Rubai ""Rabai""",Short indeed but worth a read!!,"I have no earlier idea about the secret's Roman Empire's rise and fall. This short book is an explorer for me. It is fortunately free of the typos that usually infect the quality of this type of short books and also interrupts reading. This book is not a conventional, chronological description of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. It is rather a witness of Roman Empire, which actually captures a remarkable portion of half a million of European history. Apparently, there are some other imperative periods and characters in Roman history, which might not detail in this short book. However, it's really an appreciable attempt by the author (Larry Berg) to familiarize somebody to Roman civilization that definitively influenced the western ethos. Therefore, this book is perfect one. Larry acmes some unique phases of the Roman Empire those are fairly interesting. The author also gives an emphasis on the expression of social status and political ideology indirectly of that time. This book also focuses on quite a number of contributions of the Roman emperors to the world, which are still being remembered by the modern era. I simply surprised knowing the main reasons of such a great realm fall down. At the end of the book, the author has left for us some lessons from the highs and lows of Roman civilization; those are really realistic and educative for personal and social life. I have enjoyed the book 100%. I believe once you would complete reading this short book, you definitely considered it as one of the exclusive collection of your eBooks.",5

B00L74PFPS,A2LY3V2NLZIL68,"06 24, 2014",HannahPilar,A Must Read,"Another wonderful BDSM themed book from Fated Desires. Martial Hearts is Mia Michele's first book in The Club series. It is a great introduction to not only the series but also the topic of BDSM. It is light on the subject matter but it explains some of the logic behind why people are in the lifestyle and if you are new to the theme this is a great book to start you off on it. Even if you never pick up another BDSM book again this is still a very good book to read to see if you like the genre.Damon and Mina are an unlikely pair but seem to be their best when they are together. Mina has had to live through some difficult events in her young life but because of it she is determined not to suffer again or any other woman. Mina has built her life learning self defense training other woman also she spends her free time on call to the crisis center helping counsel women who have survived rape or other physical abuse. Mina opened her dojo and has lived her closed off OCD life with only one person she calls friend. Jane is her best friend and they are the perfect example of opposites attract. Jane is a submissive and that is a topic that they girls have learned to avoid but with Jane wedding approaching Mina gives her the bachelorette party Jane wants even if it means taking place at The Club, the notorious BDSM club.Damon is and always has been a Dominate. From a young age the lifestyle is the only place he has felt comfortable enough to be himself. Sought after by any number of woman Damon is picky picking ones who satisfy his needs and vise versa, his friends refer to him as the teacher normally only finding woman in need of training. With his latest student gone and on the look out for someone new he spots one of his friends Jane with her group of friends for her bachelorette party including a stunning beauty he has never seen before one that looks like she would rather be somewhere else. Damon is instantly taken with her beauty and the fact that he wants to correct all her misconceptions of BDSM.Their is something about Damon that Mina instinctively trusts, even though she doesn't want to and it's a perpetual case of ""the lady doth protest to much"". It's a tie between her best friend vouching for him and her undeniable attraction to him that she gives in to him and becomes open to Damon therefore opening her eyes to the world of BDSM. He initial view of it isn't pleasant thinking all the woman are in denial about being in an abusive relationship and all the dominates wife beaters. Damon soon changes her mind about it all. Explaining that the submissive has the control. She doesn't believe it at first but soon realizes it when Damon demonstrates it first hand.  Damon helps her realize the life she has been leading has been a life lived in fear and she needs to take control over it. But her past comes storming into her present and threatens their happiness. Damon would do anything for Mina even the one thing that may ruin everything for them.I really, really enjoyed this book. It does have light BDSM but still very hot, very touching and funny. Unless you have already decided that you hate everything BDSM I would recommend this book to anyone.",5

One of those is Jaycee, who left after a bad experience in her twenties, and must cope with the memories of her early life, as well as with new bizarre events in the neighborhood, especially in the remaining wooded area. In a community which ought to be peaceful, neighbor-friendly, and relaxed, the tension is ratcheted up almost moment by moment, until surely something must break.I totally enjoyed this engrossing, excellent novel, which so readily suspended disbelief. As a reader, I felt more as if I was a witness, believing the odd events and sightings which occurred. Author Joan Conning Afman has a skillful wit and a deft hand with characterization; I came to know the populace of the novel as if I myself had known them for years. The paranormal or perhaps Supernatural elements work well as part of the ongoing plotting. Additionally, the author weaves in some past history, from Colonial times, and does so in such a way that it becomes another thread in the narrative. I especially appreciated the approach to history as referencing people, with their distinct emotions, drives, and fears, rather than as dry dates on a page.I applaud this novel, which I read in one sitting, totally oblivious to the world around me, and which I will definitely reread.

The biggest night of their haunting is on Valentines Day and it has once again arrived. This year he's tired of fighting them, at twenty-five he's been fighting this battle for fifteen years. He's made the decision this will be the last year. Then the unexpected happens, a green eyed beauty enters his life and she's determined to save him.Liliana Delgado has had quite a hard life. Pregnant at a young age, an autistic son, her mother is ill and more. She has chosen not to date in the seven years since her son was born. The one night she agrees to go out with Alex, only as friends, her life changes. Lili likes to try and save people and Alex's cousin Ryan is definitely in need of saving.This story is intense at times. It is worth reading but don't go into it thinking it's a warm and fuzzy romance. You'd be disappointed. There is definitely romance but the road to love is definitely an unkept back road, bumpy with plenty of deep ruts. Ryan had something really bad happen when he was young and he'd rather bury it then tell Lili the truth. Only when you bury things that aren't dead, they find a way to always come back.

B00IW8AIAY,A3VSHAAXWTKJD0,"03 10, 2014",F.A.,An Emotional Quick Read,"Just like I said, this is an emotional quick read.The Art of Forgiving a Greek Billionaire starts off Mairi Tanner trying to recover from her break up with Damen and in the mean time all is not well in Damen's world as he learns more of what Mairi has suffered and that he is also in financial ruin.When I read the scene between Mairi and Drake that was something I never expected and realize this is different from how Ms. Marian Tee writes but at the same time I felt it was necessary for the story to unfold. Although now, I kind of hate Drake but most of all Alina. I wished that part never happened and confronting Mairi verbally at her vulnerable was not good. I never realized how Drake was dangerous and deadly he was until I've read that part.From the sneak peek I got of this I had a feeling this would be different and I was right. The atmosphere while I read this was quite heavy and I had to pause then continue as I read ""The Art of Forgiving a Greek Billionaire"". Damen despite how he treated Mairi on the last book, I actually felt something for him. I knew he would be plagued guilt and heart ache but reading from his point of view cut me to the core. It's one thing to know and another to read it and it brought out a lot of emotions but most of all I think I felt numb and hopelessness for him. Although I felt like I wanted to hit Damen (actually do more than hit him) because of his treatment towards Mairi, little by little Damen seemed to be redeemed in my eyes where I wanted him to have another chance ( I lost count of how many times he screwed with Mairi so I can't say a second chance). But because of what he had gone through I think he would realize what he had was precious and when given another chance he would not make this mistake anymore and cherished what he had with Mairi more than ever.Besides the happy ending I'm looking forward to, I'm really hoping that all those people who were part of ruining Mairi and Damen's relationship will have their just dessert.Lastly when I read that Damen will let Aline be under the care of Stavros for a second I had a feeling that they might be the next couple.",5

Reading reviews before actually reading the book can be very damaging to how you perceive the outcome.****Have you ever been so involved with someone that you just 'know' that things will go on forever? You finish each other&#8217;s sentences, and know how to please each other &#8211; in and out of bed? Have you ever felt so impassioned by another human being that you would move heaven and earth for them?What would you do if that future was ripped from you without even the smallest of hints?Jared&#8217;s heartache was genuine. His love for Lizzie haunted him, as did his confusion as to why she didn&#8217;t want him.And Lizzie&#8217;s reaction was real, as well. She was frightened she would be lost in his wealth &#8211; that all of his love would take away the independence she had, even if he wanted to do things for her because he loved her so much.I have read other reviews of this book, and I cannot agree with the negative ones. You have had to be living in a cocoon not to understand the feelings that each of these characters experienced.Jared wanted Lizzie back, but he had been so blindsided that he just couldn't understand her rejection to his well thought out proposal. Lizzie was intimidated by his wealth, but not by him. The fact that they were adult enough to talk openly about what happened the night he proposed showed me that Marie Force has the heart of a true person, not some 'romance writer'. Romances tend to have that plot twist where someone just can&#8217;t get past one problem or another, but Marie did not do that here. I applaud her for that, as I have applauded her for many other emotional scenes that seem all to real.How many of us dreamed of one more chance? I am so happy that these two were given that chance, and made it work for them.Great job, Marie!",5

She finds her self in a little bit of a predicament but lucky for her Luke is there to save her from her poor decisions. After her rescue and her safe return to his home they discuss her interest in the lifestyle and his ability to help her explore. Despite his reluctance and their history he begins to show her the various elements of BDSM until they hit a snag and she runs home to her brother and sister-in-law. There are several snags in their relationship but are all necessary for the Emma and Luke to put their pasts behind them. After they each face their pasts, its definitely not what you think, they can reunite and focus on their relationship.I really enjoyed the complexity of the characters and the story overall. Both Luke and Emma have a history and a little more baggage than the rest but this only adds to the depth of each characters, how they interact and eventually come to understand each other. Not only did Emma and Luke hold a good portion of the story but the supporting characters were great. The story line including Emma's brother and sister-in-law was a great addition and crucial to Emma's development.This story has a little bit of everything! The story keeps itself going, with or without the hotness that is their sexual relationship. You just can't wait to find out what happens to everybody. As far as the spanking and sex, you won't be disappointed. All are very yummy and just like the rest of the book there is a little bit of everything, anal, flogging, spankings and some other light BDSM elements that only enhance and develop Luke and Emma's relationship.

I'm sorry but I still giggle when I read it :) And this is one of the coolest books ever. Yes we have the very awesome Ivy, and some favorite side kick characters, but have you ever wondered exactly what happened and in other's point of view? Well that's the great part! This book took a major event and broke it down in each character's part. This was so cool!!So, in the first part of the story, you meet the fairy who's bound into a type of slavery, and she'd do anything to become free of her wrongful situation. You learn that this whole situation revolves around Puck. Yes, THE Puck! Boy of boy, is he a bad guy in here. You will also find out that a big time player in the Ivy series is making an appearance and I'll put money that this means something big is gunna go down soon with her and it involves Ivy!the second story is the vampire who uses Puck to get what he wants, and kill anybody who gets in his way. Look, I'll be honest, the vampers in the series are my most favorite done well! They use a glamor to hide but a few can see how ugly they really are, and they really are not the nice guys. No glittering, no hugs and kisses, no late night dinners, unless the dust bag is eating you for dinner :) this is one of my favorite parts of the book!

This is where you did out the big picture of the whole story. This is where you get the emotions from our favorite characters. This is where I drop my jaw, jump out my chair, and let out a few profanities. I can't believe Ivy did that to Jinx! I can't believe Mr HAWT piece Demon isn't gunna kill over it! I can't believe THAT finally happened AND it's almost like it was erased.... Ooooooh this is gunna come back to haunt somebody, or bite something in the ass LOL!! And hot damn, I'm all in on the demon HAWT piece! I'm so very glad I got to see into that man's head and now I'm thinking about everything but his head!even though this is a short story, it reads like an extra fast, incredibly action packed novel.

She is determined to go back to France for her three month training and excise him forever from her brain so she can return to the States to marry her mentor Steve.Despite Mary-Beth's efforts to keep her relationship strictly professional with Yves, event after event keep occurring until she is forced to accept that there is no way she can proceed with her intended marriage to Steve. Both of the main characters keep fighting their feelings for each other, until a crisis occurs when Mary-Beth is seriously injured in a fall from a horse and Yves realizes how much he loves her and wishes he had not waited to tell her. He blames himself for her injury thinking if he had only spoken up, she would have been paying more attention to the path and not have turned back to him to tell him of her decision of whether to accept the three year fellowship he had offered her.

It is fascinating to watch this story unfold through his eyes. Like so many times in real life, the perspective changes. The way we see something today with new information and insights may seem completely different tomorrow. The other characters evolve as he gets to know them and himself better. He is changed by them, and vice versa.The beauty of this story is really how this character evolves and comes full circle.The story is... not dark, but certainly at times it lives in deep shades of gray. Krylov keeps these characters struggling on the edge of a psychological knife. There is really good sex, some bdsm, some m/f/m, but mostly it is just about these two very strong male characters and their fragile hearts. It's not sex for the point of throwing in sex.

He understands that everyone has different types of stress and there are different ways to help reduce it, not juts one fix for everyone.

It doesn't matter if you are stressed about work or family or just the day-to-day, this book can help you. It will help you level the playing field of life and give you more of an advantage. I can attest to the fact that when you lose a lot of your stress, you feel much better and life is more enjoyable. I learned about things that I hadn't even thought of to reduce my stress to more manageable levels. I work a lot, and this book has made it so I can work a lot and not feel so run down by it.

The Boudreaux and Charles are going into business together and Darryl is the engineer that will oversee the project as the architect bring their vision to fruition. There journey take you on a roller coaster ride but it is much fun. I love how Deborah shows these two strong will people go from enemies to lovers.  Once Darryl and Camryn decided to call a truce to get this project done that is where the fun begins.You will not be able to put this book down once you begin reading; the Boudreaux family is quickly becoming my favorite series.  Darry & Camryn bring the heat along with fire and of course there is always somebody who will always try to come between the lovers. Although Asia tried and fail to break them up let just say that Camryn is not easily scared, there was moment where you will want Darryl to put Asia in her place but the thing I learn about Darryl he is a lot like his older brother Mason. You will also see that once he has had enough he will do what need to be done to make sure Camryn his happy.  They are TRULY YOURS TO EACH OTHER.

""NicStar""",Sweet and touching story about second chances!,"This was a really nice story which was part of a Christmas Anthology.It's fairly short and tells the tale of Mitch, a ballet dancer, who returns from the city to his father's ranch in Texas. His father passed away six months previously but it is only now that Mitch is returning as he needs somewhere to run after being betrayed by his boyfriend. On his way to the ranch he meets up with Web, who was his first love.This is a story of misunderstandings that have kept the men apart for years. On the night that Mitch wanted them to come out and spend a life together, they argued. Mitch then came out to his father who immediately threw him out and he hasn't been home since. All those wasted years!The re-ignition of the flame between Web and Mitch, Web's wonderful family, the ex-boyfriend showing up, the truth coming out and final admission of true feelings - I love a happy ending!The only thing that has me puzzled/worried was the reindeer hallucinations that Mitch seemed to have. Maybe he needs a check up!",5

The quality of writing was impressive and the characters were easy to identify and sympathise with.I could not see that ending coming! I am so impressed that the author could throw me like that.Brilliant book which managed to stir up so many emotions in such a short space of time. I loved this.Only criticism was that we never find out what the deal was with Ida and her weird son... what the heck was going on there??

When you first get into this book it's like a lot of problems others are attempting to fix but then you realize they are all tied to one.Soon after the blast it all comes together just who is with who and why as they escape.One passage I read that reminded me of why I like the author's style of words was when describing the sunset and I could feel the wind in my face, see the colors transpire in front of me and the smells and sounds of the area.From the first page there is action and adventure and it never stops. As the tale is told the lives of those on the page not only come to life but you remember them from the previous book and there are other new people that mingle in with the others.Love the locale of the steel mill and all the hidden passageways as some escape and some don't...

B004PLMI4G,A2PMAXUN6RDOMY,"10 17, 2011",Sheryl S. Brown,Bagpipes and Bullshot - A book to curl up with.,"Bagpipes & BullshotIf you are so impressed by the important but unobtrusive detail of the story, you find yourself assuming the author has experience of the subject she is writing about, you know you are settling into a good book.  Janice Horton has clearly done her research, all kudos to her.So, to the story: The impressive, but rundown, Buchanan Estate needs a large injection of cash.  Laird Innes Buchanan therefore seems duty-bound to marry into the wealthy neighbouring McKenzie family.  Indeed, as far as his intended, the beautiful but manipulative Davina McKenzie is concerned, Innes is hers, bar the actual ceremony, which she immediately sets about arranging.  Small problem, Innes doesn't love her.  His younger brother does.  Deciding not to go through with the marriage, Innes embarks on a mission to save the estate by other means.  To this end, he enlists the help of Texan cattle expert, Orley McKenna, to help him breed a hardy new herd of cattle, which might eventually generate enough income to sustain them.  Innes, though, admires Orley for more than her brains and sassiness.  He's fallen for her, big time, and Orley's heart belongs to Innes.The course of true love never did run smooth though.  Not only does Orley have to contend with disapproving Lady Buchannan's haughty frostiness, local gossip, and the unforgiving climate of the Scottish Highlands, she also has to survive the vengeful plotting of a woman scorned: Davina, who still believes herself to be engaged to Innes, and whom Innes has neglected to mention.All the elements for a terrific story, then.  Throw some humorous escapades into the plot and some beautifully descriptive writing around the geography - and you have a hugely satisfying read.  Loved it!",5

B00JDYN8Y4,AI9N25KOQU9UO,"04 2, 2014","Valeria ""The Mad Reader""",My favourite Onslow Boy so far,"What can I say? C.J. did it again! Even better, I think Ringer is my absolute favourite Onslow Boy. I know I say that every time, I guess I&#8217;m a bit easy when it comes to these Onslow Boys, but I mean it. Ringer, oh my! He&#8217;s just the best. Funny, protective, bold and mischievous, definitely my type of boy.I&#8217;m so glad we got to see this side of Ringer. It was a part of him that was missing from the other books. But what I love the most (yes, I&#8217;ll use the word love a lot because that is what I feel for this book) is the process we see him go through. From the lonely ranger of the group, the untamable stud that was unwilling to fall for all the gooey eyed love his mates had fallen into, to a man in love. Quite beautiful to witness.I also adore that this book was different from the others in several aspects which gave the series a fresh touch. It just adds to C.J.&#8217;s creativity. Once again, we are not in Onslow; this time we get transported to Ballen, apparently a town in the middle of nowhere. But this time around, we also get away from the group and focus exclusively on Ringer and Miranda. We do get to see the gang for a bit, don&#8217;t worry, they are there, just not that present in this one.Nevertheless, my favourite part was that, unlike the other books, this one was told from two different points of view. It&#8217;s the first time we get an Onslow Boy&#8217;s point of view! The stories have always been told from the girl&#8217;s point of view, but now we got both, and it was amazing! I really loved it, it added so much to the story.Miranda, is a whole other story. I felt like a really made a connection with her, because even if all the Girls in this series go through a maturing process, Miranda was the one whose growth was more tangible. You can see her experiencing all those life changing decisions. I loved her wit and boldness too! That girl is not afraid to get what she wants! At first I didn&#8217;t get her much, she reminded me a bit about Amy, with being all spoiled and all. But once you get to know her and her demons, you get her.But mostly, I loved their relationship and to see how it developed. As I said before, Ringer was always the funny of the group, and he didn&#8217;t disappoint. The cool thing is that Miranda was up for the challenge. Her love-hate relationship was hilarious and you could feel the sexual tension between them. I dare say C.J.&#8217;s writing is getting better, because I felt she truly managed to capture their feelings, processes and essence.In sum! This is an enticing story that will have you turning pages (or clicking in my case) until you are done! It is a fun and fast paced read that makes an excellent addition to the series. If you are an Onslow Boys fan, you cannot miss out on Ringer!!*Note: I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review, but my opinion was not biased in any way by this fact.",5

This man is Devin Trent, former rodeo star,  now running his ranch with the weight of guilt and loss on his shoulders.  His wife Olivia  passed away three years ago from breast cancer.  She was a stained glass artist, and her work remains in her studio in his home.  He has not entered her studio  nor looked at her work since the day she died.Claire Best is living in Morning Lake working at a gallery, and is a photographer. She moved here to take care of her grandmother, who has since passed away. She left Claire her sprawling old house, which Claire loves, but can't afford to keep up.  She now lives in rooms built above the garage, and rents the house to summer boarders.Claire and Devin's first meeting is not a pleasant one. He escorts Shirley, Olivia's mother, to the gallery to discuss showing some of Olivia's work, which he has no intention of allowing to happen. It doesn't matter that the showing is to benefit Cancer Research.  Devin is immediately confronted by a stunning portrait of Olivia in the window of the gallery.  He is livid.  Claire had taken the photo of Olivia on a visit to her studio not long after Olivia's diagnosis .  Devin wants it  removed, now.The attraction is immediate, but Claire and Devin have secrets they do not want to share.Claire is also dealing with the teenage son of her boarders, left alone, and looking for trouble.  Devin witnesses some of this boy's destruction, and steps in.  It's not so much  about Olivia's work anymore, it's about Devin and Claire's emotions, and their reluctance to let go of their fears and insecurities.I enjoyed this novel, finished it in one sitting.

In the meantime, however, she is obligated to fulfill a series of bookings in a string of rugged Western towns. Shooter's Cross, Texas, is her next scheduled stop.In addition to her singing talents, Songbird also possesses some surprising self-defense skills that have served her well in many of the tough towns where she has performed.And now it looks like they may be needed once again in Shooter's Cross. Other players -- some already present in town, others converging even as Songbird arrives -- are on courses aimed to intersect with hers, few in a good way.Luckily, Songbird knows she can always count on her Chinese traveling companion, Ying, who practices defensive techniques at an even higher level than hers, to have her back. And she is about to learn she can also count on several Rancho Diablo hands (including one, in particular, who is smitten with her) to pitch in when the going gets tough.Bill Crider is the writer behind the Colby Jackson byline this time around, and he turns in another winner in this highly popular (and rightfully so) Western series.SONGBIRD has plenty of action, a healthy dose of humor, a smidge of romance, and colorful characters galore. Songbird and Ying make a particularly memorable pair the reader will be left wanting to see more of. Also of note is a pack of bumbling would-be outlaw brothers -- one who has been conked in the head and left mentally unbalanced, another who endured a low blow in the same altercation that injured his brother and is now suffering his own delicate damage.Terrific Western entertainment.

B00DFFMYOW,ARACFU5SUPKC2,"11 6, 2013",Angie,Some Like It Spicy,"I use to be really addicted to Top Chef, Hell's Kitchen, and Master Chef, so I figured I'd enjoy Some Like it Spicy. I was expecting a quick and fun romance set against the backdrop of reality TV, but I wasn't expecting to fall madly in love with it! I became so immersed in Ashton and Ty's romance that I actually cried tears of joy at the end, even though I'm typically annoyed by the cliche engagement type endings. This was just an amazing book. It has great characters (although it took me a bit to warm up to Ashton), a great premise, a super fun plot, and a sexy romance! There's also plenty of scandal and real life problems, too, but surprisingly those didn't take away from my enjoyment, which sometimes happens.Some Like it Spicy follows Ashton as she competes on a popular Top Chef-like reality show. She was hesitant to sign on, but her business partners convinced her that she'd be doing it for all them, since her restaurant is sinking. There she meets the host, and head judge, Ty Cates. It's an instant attraction, but there's also some antagonism there, since Ashton is quite the strong personality and very defensive. Of course, their attraction is only heightened by the fact that it's illegal for them to be involved while the show is filming. They have to sneak around, or at least get creative with the time they're allowed alone together. I love forbidden romance, so I loved Ashton and Ty! Their sexual chemistry is through the roof and they find themselves in some sticky situations.In addition to the romance, I absolutely loved the whole reality TV set up. Some Like it Spicy takes us on set, back stage, and beyond! It was a lot of fun seeing the inner workings of so-called &#34;reality&#34; television. I never thought about it much, but this seems like how it probably works. I felt like I was actually watching The Next Top Celebrity Chef along with the outtakes specials. We get to see all of the challenges which made my tummy rumble, and the grueling long hours of reshooting and interviews. Then we follow the contestants back to their house, and really get to see all of the different personalities. There are a couple of stereotypes, but they were clearly there to fill a specific role on the TV show, so that didn't bother me. I grew to absolutely adore Jolene and her mission to make health food tasty!Some Like it Spicy was a very welcome surprise. It's probably snagged the position of my favorite Contemporary Romance. I just loved everything about it, except that it made me really hungry and I wanted to climb into the pages to steal some of the food! I laughed, I cried, I swooned! This romance really does have it all!*Disclaimer: I received this book from the publisher through NetGalley for review. No compensation was offered or accepted.",5
B005UA0WOE,A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"04 17, 2012","LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re...",Fantastic Read,"What's better than having a hot date with a handsome cowboy? How about three cowboys (the handsome cowboy and his handsome younger twin brothers)?The ""date"" wasn't even supposed to happen, but with a twist of fate, Audrey Anderson was roped into getting together with Jackson Gray Wolf and his twin brothers, Mark and Luke. It was Jackson's 30th birthday and his brothers wanted to help him celebrate it despite his insistence on not having a party. So they arranged for a stripper to show up for their little party. Audrey had run out of strippers to send, but her assistant Charli had promised the Gray Wolf twins a stripper and they had already paid. Audrey decided that even though her alter ego, Kiki, had hung up her stripping title a while back, she would have to make good on the promise of a stripper for the party. The gig went so well that Jackson was determined to find out who the mystery stripper really was.Boots and Chaps was a take on the Cinderella story, with Kiki leaving something significant behind. Even though it didn't take much for Jackson to put two and two together, it was still fun to see what transpired. Kiki/Audrey had recently ended an abusive relationship and was contemplating her future when the Gray Wolf cowboys caught her attention. Audrey wasn't confident about getting into another relationship so she maintained her distance and true identity with her Kiki persona. She was also concentrating on making the Ugly Stick Saloon a success with great bar patronage and a ""stable"" of strippers to supply for parties.Jackson is a responsible man who had to grow up very early when his parents passed away, leaving him to take care of his younger twin brothers. He's a really good guy who isn't sure he would want to spank Kiki/Audrey or share her with his brothers, but he's learning to widen his horizons for her. The twins Mark and Luke are eager and willing to do anything to please Audrey.The supporting characters of Charli and Greta Sue (the bouncer) helped add some lightheartedness to the story. The story moves along quickly with lots of hot scenes between Audrey, Jackson, Mark, and Luke, in various combinations. This is a woman's answer to all the guys who are always joking about and wishing for a couple of hot women (possibly twins) in their bed with them. Even though Audrey wasn't looking for three hot guys to fall in love with, she really appreciates the bonus studs in bed with her.Ms. Jackson's writing makes the story enjoyable, with a plot that entertains and just the right amount of descriptions that enables the reader to envision the Western scenes. Since I am a suburban city girl, I enjoy reading about stories that take place in a different type of setting and Ms. Jackson did not disappoint me.For a great erotic short story that fulfills a woman's kinky wish for three handsome and kind cowboys, who can please her and know the boundaries, look for Boots and Chaps!Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews",5

Ms. Bailey's characters just draw you into the story, making you feel everything they are feeling in the book.

Her books just keep getting better and better, and considering that her debut novel, Protecting What's His, is my all time favorite romance novel...that's saying something.

Along the way they detour to their grandparents ranch in Texas and have a few laughs.  This isn't just another summer vacation for Charlie.  The end of the road is a singing competition that could be life changing.I simply adored this novel!  It is a coming of age story told in alternating points of view of the two sisters.  Charlie is the sister who is always getting into trouble.  She feels like she gets blamed for everything that goes wrong.  Lucy is the perfect sister who feels as if no one really knows her. Reading about the sisters from both perspectives was brilliant.  Each sister truly meant well but felt equally misunderstood.  They both yearn for the friendship they used to have at a younger age.When they stop at their grandparents ranch in Texas we see both girls reminisce about simpler, happier times.  I loved reading about their love for the ranch and their family.  We also see the girls embark on young love with a few of the sweet (and handsome) ranch hands.Overall we see two sisters who ultimately become closer to each other learn the value of sisterhood, being themselves, and coming of age.

B00G8BHJB8,A3V9YBORZ7V40C,"01 13, 2014",Heather,"""Fighting"" is used in several different ways","I received and ARC of Fighting Irish in exchange for an honest review so here it goes...WOW! You totally can submerse yourself into this book like you can with the other two books of the series. Overall it deals with a simple storyline that many of us have read before, but how Gina writes it is definitely a refreshing twist. We're not just talking hot guy meets damaged girl and swoon her into his bed, makes love to her, gives her hope and there you go and they live happily ever after. In this story, damaged girl knows who she is, what she's gone through past and present but then FIGHTS to have better while needing someone to show her true intimacy and dare I say love. Insecurities and defense mechanisms are clearly there with Kat, you would have them to if you were emotionally and physically and sadly sexually abused growing up.Lets talk about Super Woman aka Kat...selfless and a survivor, her character was written beautifully. When learning about her as I read, she's aware of her past, puts it as far away in her mind as possible. Protects her sister, even though it kills her by having very little contact with her because she's totally aware of her situation her ex put her in and the scumbags she interacts with, she gets it, she understands it, and she keeps her sister far away from it as possible. You would think after all the bad hands she had been dealt with in her young life, she would have insecurities 10miles wide and just be cold and standoffish and maybe a little wishy washy right? Nope, she &#34;gets it&#34; and lives with those crap hands always and is constantly on the defensive, she knows she's missing out on love and normalcy with her life by confiding in someone but she cant afford to have it because that would be another person to watch out for not only to stay under the radar, but fear of endangering an innocent person or worse getting caught while on the run. Always the protector to not only for herself but for others.Now lets talk about Aiden aka &#34;Irish&#34; aka great book boyfriend material ;) Again, great character development, not too cocky or caveman or even too stubborn. Most male characters that are athletes can be just that, all alpha and cocky and has to learn to be compassionate and less forceful but not Irish. He's an alpha, don't get me wrong, but more of a protector alpha when seeing someone needing help and showing how he deals with hard situations. His hands maybe roughed with callouses, but the tenderness and patience he shows with Kat is sweet and very male. He knows not to push if Kat doesn't want to when first helping her overcome her blank out moments during an intimate moment. He understands that she can't just switch it off, but her mind has to be retrained into accepting a mans touch and help who's not asking for anything in return. He worries about her life getting right and her pleasure, my goodness does he go full tilt when it comes to her pleasure! He has a dark past to, something he will always carry with him, but Kat saw it as her chance to give back and help him like he has help her. In a way he wordlessly agreed to himself that her problems were now his problems no matter how much he wanted to fight it.Irish and Kat ignite the sheets, giving and taking equaling, trusting and expressing so much passion and it's never too much. Always balanced and not always the same thing which can happen. You could have multiple love scenes in a story, but if placed right and written a little differently you can easily recall them all because each one is a little different then the last. With Kat and Aiden they kind of needed to be because Aiden is showing Kat ways of expressing passion and love which later on gives Kat courage to be a little bolder each time and she sets the pace in some way to. Aiden may get alpha a little, hot and exciting by the way, but he's always communicating with her in some way whether by touch or looking at him, keeping her in the current reality which gets easier and easier as the story progresses.They work together to heal each others past wounds and to overcome the adversities that come their way when dealing with Sicole and his goons. Standing together not pushing each other away from each other when the situation gets tough or too much they make a great team and in more ways than one, the fight with everything they've got.",5

As I started reading it was so true to life that it was hard to believe that actually I was reading a novel.Our Science Hero, Professor Halligan, will find himself the new Director General of the Super Collider in Geneva.  The problem is he arrives just as the world starts to melt down in a series of natural disasters that seems unparalleled in human history.  An earthquake destroys Ankara, Turkey.  Then another earthquake destroys San Francisco.  Then more natural disasters.But at the same time the Super Collider has an accident and two maintenance workers are killed.  Or are they murdered?  Enter the police and the investigation starts.  Professor Halligan will find himself the center of the investigation.  But did he really do anything.So, we have three stories that will run simultaneously:1.  A Murder Investigation2.  A Science phenomenon that may be the beginning of the end of the world3.  A Romance story (Oh, did I forget to mention the lovely Serena, a scientist at the Collider that Tom falls head over heals for in just five minutes?)Danser weaves all of these items together along with the character development of a police inspector, another scientist that seems to have gone insane and a secret society of scientists that seem to have their own agenda.Professor Tom Halligan will find that he has to save the world, save the girl, save the secret society of scientists and keep himself out of jail all at the same time.The story is plausible, frightening and full of excitement.You won't be able to put the book down until you have finished.

And now that Emmy is back in his arms, will Ben be able to make her stay?This continuing love story still kept me completely captivated.

I love  that the author didn't make it easy...Oh no they were going to have to work for that happy ending.Best friend Ellie still provided some comic relief and her love/hate relationship with Bray is something I'm hopeful will be explored more in the future.Overall this is a well written story about two people trying to make their way back to each other desperately not wanting to hurt each other in the process.

I wondered whether I might think it was so so.  In fact, I loved it.  It did bring to mind The Exorcist, The Omen, etc (which have all been done and done). Richard Goodship's book, though, brings a fresh slant to the genre that had me immediately wanting to read more.  The Forensic Investigation side (beautifully done, supplying just enough information to convince you that the author knows his stuff) added an extra dimension and an intelligent twist that had me quietly congratulating the author.  I have to admit to be being a bit of a Dexter fan, and I could (really) visualise this ranking alongside it.  Bill Walters is a fascinating character - flawed and believable - as is his reluctant psychologist/partner Tom.  The touches of humour between the two men is spot on. I can see this partnership running.  I liked that the religious undertones flowed through the book in such a way as not to weigh it down or detract from the story.

Jeda is a perfect anti-hero, and the girls Kala and Kara are so different from each other and unique - I was really impressed with how the authors developed them.  The Black and White Covens created a wonderful contrast and I found it highly entertaining; the Assassin's Guild is just vague enough that you are drawn between unease over the assassinations, and interest that they would provide this sort of service for hire.

B00HI5WHSI,A3UB7X7FZ5VPT2,"03 23, 2014",Margaret Johnson,Redemption is Sweet,"The entire Den of Sin series has been one of my most enjoyable reads in that it allows the reader to look beyond the things that hinders the journeys on our respective paths.  This is excellently conveyed in Redeeming the Amazon. I could hardly wait to get my hands on this book and I wasn&#8217;t in the least bit disappointed.The story of Karen and Paul really resonated with me, not only because of their respective disabilities but the keen sense of intimacy that had nothing to do with the sizzling passion that ran just under the surface. This intimacy, born of hesitation and realization was far more satisfying than any of the decadent love scenes in that it allows the reader to really explore the core of a character. I was enthralled by Karen&#8217;s duality; she was at once strong and vulnerable, unwavering in her desires but unwilling to make any commitments, despite what her heart was telling her. She is a survivor in every sense of the word and that in itself makes her the most beautiful woman in the world. It&#8217;s her spirit that I couldn&#8217;t get enough of, that even though she was missing a part of her femininity she wasn&#8217;t willing to let life just pass her by. Her conundrum was that she had so much more invested in Paul than she realized and it took him and his own strength through adversity to shake those cobwebs loose. She could have love and still be desirable, regardless of her perceived loss.Conversely, Paul is the epitome of strength himself; fully acclimated but not necessarily comfortable with his disability, he takes up the mantle, ready to claim the woman he let slip through his fingers so many years ago.  Knowing that Paul was strong enough to fight those invisible demons of doubt that had festered within Karen made the story that much more fulfilling. I found myself unwilling to turn the last page knowing that it would inevitably bring to an end, such a perfectly constructed portrait of the strength of the human spirit.As always, I continue to be in awe of Ms. Lewis&#8217; ability to weave such a complex, thoroughly enjoyable story that is told with so much passion that it practically jumps off the page. I will continue to read and support Ms. Lewis as she endeavors to fill the world with beauty and love through her words.Excellent work, Ms. Lewis!",5

This is especially true when I see people without a college degree doing quite well for themselves if not better. They are confident, smart and focused. So what is their secret?This is the answer that Vivian Morgan&#8217;s ebook seeks to give. We have always been concerned if not obsessed with IQ; psychologists today however are of the opinion that while determining an individual&#8217;s success approximately 10% can be attributed to IQ. They agree that other qualities like initiative, empathy as well as leadership potential gives better work performance.The subject matter of this book risks getting academic beyond a point. However the author knowing this has intelligently devised a way to keep the reader&#8217;s interest alive. The thoughtfully designed chapters do the trick to a certain extent by letting the readers know exactly what they are gaining from each chapter.What makes the book an interesting read is of course the later chapters that discuss the scope of application of EQ in the educational, professional and administrative field.Emotional intelligence is slowly gaining a sturdy reputation as a near accurate marker of an individual&#8217;s personality and is poised to play a greater role in the decision making of our lives.

Having no previous knowledge of any kind of Russian history (besides things like the Romanov's from the movie Anastasia) I found this book to be highly educational while entertaining. A feat few books can ever accomplish.Dimitry was a well fleshed out character and his adventure back in time was well executed. I find that sometimes books that hop back and forth between timelines to be very confusing. Not so with this one.  I think the fact that the author took the time to make the people from the past SOUND like the people from the past made all the difference.Highly recommend to anyone looking for an historical fiction book with just the right touch of sci-fi.",5

Lisa Kessler.I loved Lisa's first book Moonlight,  so was really pleased to get the next. Its another cracker with story lines to keep reader engrossed and characters that we can empathise with. Its not a single plot book but one with multiple ones, some that get tied up in this novel, and some that continue the theme that begun in the first - a sort of umbrella plot that all others sideline from.So, we meet Adam and Lana once again from the first book, along with their twins and some of the other characters. This book centres on Adams' twin Aren. He was in the last book, and was shot by the Jaguar assassin Sasha - what he hasn't told anyone is that when she touched him he discovered she was his mate. It works differently for Jaguars though - the Wolf one true mate doesn't happen to them so she will have no idea...By chance Sasha is in trouble and needs help to protect her younger sister. Aren didn't tell anyone but he ensured Sasha was saved during that final battle, even though she had shot him. She doesn't know why of course, but lacking anyone else to help her she turns to Aren. This leads us into another amazing romance, hot and steamy, emotional and full of highs one moment, and lows the next when things go wrong for the couple. The threat to her sister is all too real, and very dangerous and Aren is worried for not only Sasha and her sister, but for the Pack too - and of course what will they think when they know he's involved with the woman who they think tried to kill him. Along with that there are secrets coming out from all directions that affect how the can protect Sasha, her siater and the Pack, from the characters themselves, from the Pack and from the Nero organisation....Its a great read, real edge of seat at times, made me laugh, made me almost cry, the very best of books for me - I need all that angst and emotion in a story and not just sweetness and love. Priced at 2.79 for 340 pages its great value and will join my keepers file for re reading.ARC provided via publishers.Stars: five - great read :)",5

The first novel that I ever read by her was wasWatermelon. That novel introduces you to the family Walsh and the eldest daughter Claire. I completely fell in love with Clarie, her nutty family, and felt for her dealing with having a baby to care for and her husband deciding that he is in love with someone else.In subsequent novels Marian Keyes has updated her readers on the Walsh family inRachel's Holiday,Angels, andAnybody Out There?.  All of these novels have focused on one of the Walsh daughters and updates you on the other members of the family.  I know that Marian Keyes last Walsh family novel is coming out in a few months so she put together this short novella that provides more in depth details into the Walsh family told by the Walsh girl's mother.I really loved this novella since it updates long-time readers on all of the girls (Claire, Rachel, Margaret, Anna, and Helen) though in Anna's case her update is deliberately left vague. For readers of ""Anybody Out There"" you know why and I guess inThe Mystery of Mercy Closewe may finally figure out who Anna is with.However, we are also provided new information that I was happy to read about. I do love all of the A to Z's that she goes into and I cracked up on certain sections such as A is for Alcohol and F is for Feathery Stroker.The novella also allows readers into a sneak peek at ""The Mystery of Mercy Close"" novel.",5

B0045JK408,A3I7KV16A58BTN,"04 13, 2012","Stacie Theis ""BeachBoundBooks""","Stories of Selflessness, Hope and Faith","Water and Other Stories by Daron Froley contains three moving stories that touch your heart.The first story, Petitions,  tells the story of a homeless man named Mark. Petitions takes you deep into Mark's life and allows you to see his personal struggles which have landed him on the street corner. Mark's act of selflessness at the end of the story gave me goosebumps.  Petitions reminds us of the timeless saying, ""never judge a book by it's cover.""The second story, Angel's Song, is ""a companion short story to the novel The Thorn book one of The Chronicles of Gan."" Angel's Song is about healing, forgiveness, and hope as Jacob deals with the death of his father, which he blames himself for. When angel's bring Jacob news of the birth of the King he realizes all is forgiven and he is surprised by the presence of one very special angel.The third story, Water, is ""based on the account found in the Gospel of John, chapter 5, versus 1-16, and the painting by Carl Bloch, Healing at the Pool of Bethesda."" Moshe is a thin feeble man who is unable to walk. He waits everyday by a pool hoping for a miracle that will heal his frail body. His son has lost hope and believes his father is foolish, yet Moshe's faith never wavers. One day he is visited by a stranger. Moshe is afraid, but finds comfort in the stranger's tender eyes. Is this who Moshe has been waiting for?  Water teaches us that no matter how bleak things appear, never lose faith.",5

Fedora is a smooth, self-assured operative with years of experience, first seconded to the FBI and then with WWII approaching, working for the British government to fight the Axis powers. Now with the war over and expecting to be out of a job, he is offered a role in the new British External Intelligence. This book is the first adventure he has for them and what an adventure. The writing is crisp and sure, the action flows swiftly from one thrill to another, and the author lets you see feel like you are watching it. I cannot recommend this book, and this series, enough.

You don't have to be a ""country fan"" to appreciate the theme, but you have to love music and appreciate the ""southern way of life""~Humor...If a book is nothing but the heavy stuff, it can feel overwhelming. I found myself so engrossed in the book, that I was randomly laughing and didn't even realize it. I LOVE sarcastic banter with the characters, and this book had it in spades.~Love and Romance...Dear Lordy, did this book have it! On all kinds of levels...Love between family members and siblings, love in a menage relationship, love for ones self, love for your best friends, love for ones you've lost. It was incredibly touching and moved me.~The Tears...Sweet Jesus, did I cry with this book. I try to never do spoilers in reviews, and you can get an overview of the book in the blurb for it, but this book had me, like, snotty all over crying at one point. My daughter even voiced her concern when she saw me sniffing behind my kindle LOL. It's a good release, so do not go past about 40% without tissues handy.ALPHA FREAKIN' MALES Holy crap...you have all the alpha males you can possibly choose from in this book! Ex-Marines, Country Music Stars, I mean DAMN...and they are fan your panties hot to boot!!!And finally...the SEX!!! These alpha males have some dirty little mouths in the bedroom, and they are ALL about pleasure for their ladies. Loving their woman up hard, and putting her first. It was just pretty damn hot!!The way the book played out (a long journey for the characters) in my opinion, reminded me of the book Taking Chances. The plots were nothing alike, but when I was reading this one, that book somehow came to mind. It was just an incredible story filled with erotic dialogue, love, loss, country music, hope, grief and love again. I would recommend this book to EVERYONE. It will definitely stay with me for a long while",5
B00JDOWAN4,A1ZHB20774AVOX,"07 13, 2014",Jacqui,A compelling read!,"I have read all the books in this series, and they just keep getting better and better. In this novel, we find out quite a lot more about the pasts of both Romney and Marsh, who for different reasons, have a number of dark secrets from their pasts. The book provides an effective balance between a compelling murder mystery and engagement with interesting, complex characters. The Dover setting in the series is a character in its own right, and like Romney and Marsh, with each book, we discover its positives and negatives. Although it seems to be a common convention in British detective writing to have a pair who work together, it is to Tidy's credit that he avoids the stereotyped relationship we see in so many of these novels. This is not a predictable or comfortable relationship, but factors that create the loyalty that makes Romney and Marsh an effective team are fascinating in their own right.I look forward to reading the next book in the series.",5

The writing is excellent to exquisite.  the characters are believable (including the hero, who can do amazing things, but is still extremely human).  the setting is lovingly and meticulously drawn, in several locales, and the story left me absolutely breathless on more than one occasion.I especially enjoyed some of the side action, for example, the examination of hip hop music ...with which I am absolutely unacquainted, and the insight into lifestyles with which I do not have, and will never have experience.  they added texture and color to this book, without detracting in the least from the story line.  In fact, the author drew all the threads together in a smooth, professional manner that impressed me.Toward the end, I admit to thinking *now* what's going to happen?

So, very romance books deal with women of a certain age and/or a certain size.  This series does a great job of showing how we all need and want love no matter our age or size.  Our main character in this book, Lauren is a divorced woman who was cheated on terribly by her first husband.  Her response to that was to simply shut down romantically.  She takes any physical urges she might have in her own hands (so to speak) and remains celebate for 8 years.  The only man that makes her feel anything...is Jim...whose married...or at least she thinks he's married because she never sees his wife...this is going to be complicated.

Alec is dragged from his safe world when a secret from his mother&#8217;s past comes calling, and that secret is determined to get what he wants. As his friends and family are brutally attacked Alec struggles with what is happening and even as he gets close to Jared he still finds it hard to accept the fanciful truth that Jared tells him, but Alec will have to face the truth and trust Jared if he is to beat the evil that stalks him.This is a brilliant paranormal horror story that has pretty graphic details and a wonderful storyline. Jared discovered first-hand what Alec faces and is hoping to help Alec before tragedy strikes, but he wants more than to be just friends. Alec doesn&#8217;t know what to believe but he can&#8217;t keep away from Jared, now they face a danger that comes from the past, a past that his mother has kept well hidden. The police are looking into the disappearances of numerous people and brutal killings and there is a link to a body missing from the morgue&#8230;. and Alec, but there is no way the police would ever believe the truth even if Alec did know what was going on.I really enjoyed this story; it called to that part of me that enjoys horror and gore. This brilliant storyline starts as boy gets set up with boy and hits it off, it then quickly moves on with the danger and horror seeping in and we discover secrets of the past. There&#8217;s a whole host of characters who are involved in this story and all their parts are important and whose point of view we also see the story from, we have Ilene (Alec&#8217;s mother) who made a mistake that now haunts her, we have Lucy (Alec&#8217;s sister) who is dragged into the horror along with her boyfriend Rene. Then we have the police detectives who are trying to piece together the clues in their cases where Alec&#8217;s name keeps cropping up.This story is so far from your typical werewolf story. In fact, if you are looking for a sweet fluffy read with wolves finding mates and living happily ever after, after a bit of angst and conflict then don&#8217;t even think of picking up this book. But if you want something that&#8217;s dark and dangerous with bloodshed and horror then this story is a must. I loved how this story was written, you get pulled into the story from the first pages, and it makes you keep turning the pages even when you know something horrific is coming. We see an astonishing amount of emotions in this story with guilt, fear, anger, horror, grief and heartbreak being the main contenders, we do see some happiness but not much as events seem to steamroll out of control. The werewolf in this story is the stuff of nightmares, returning to the original folklore of them in the past where they were true monsters. This story is a part of something bigger, as you learn throughout the book, and even as they have a semblance of a happy ending you know it is far from over for them all.I have to recommend this to those that love horror, dark paranormal, a brilliant storyline, great characters, a love that evolves even with danger and horror raining down, and an ending that makes you wonder that comes next.",5

B005DV9X90,AWPGONL6WG86Q,"01 5, 2013","K. Ree ""Kitty Muse Book Reviews""",Kitty Muse Book Reviews,"For minutes, my mouth hangs open, silently screaming just like my aft monitor yesterday. Slowly, my overheated haywire brain cools down and reorders itself. I force myself to think objectively. The good news is that two of the five paths show the black hole careening close to Uranus, and then heading out Wild, Wild West into deep space. Unfortunately, in the other three, Uranus actually boosts it East toward the Sun, brushing Mars a little tidally. But the worst is that it then captures the Earth and Luna--swallowing them for lunch or dragging them along for a snack later as it sweeps out West past the Sun. Serenely, I determine that such results may be very bad for Godspeed's business profile. All my retirement stock, for example, will be worth less than the aneurysm that's probably shaping up now in my brain. Calmly, I scream, ""YOU STUPID BASTARDS!"" Referring, of course, to the bubble heads at Godspeed.Naomi Kinder gave up her personal life and any chance at romance when she took the job as sweeper pilot in the wilds of deep space.  Her responsibility:  to mend space-time rifts with specialized particle beams.Life is as normal as it gets while spinning through space, until she suddenly finds Something Really Big on her tail.  And that Really Big Thing could spell the difference between losing her job and losing her life.  Either way, she can count herself out of a future.All she wants is an early retirement, and what she gets is a black hole chewing up space in her wake.  So does she tell the head honchos at Godspeed?  That sort of publicity is not their favorite.  But if no action is taken, there wouldn't be anyone left to care one way or another.Between Naomi and the lab on Mars, the decision is secretly made to fly to a distant moon, where another ship with ""other"" capabilities has been hidden  There she would transfer goods and necessary equipment to it, and set into motion a string of processes that will deflect the oncoming monster.Plans change, however, when a UN security agent joins her on the little moon, but not with an interest in alliance.  At least not at first.  Once he is convinced of the actuality of the situation, he dives right in to help Naomi ""fool"" the black hole into its final destruction.I don't usually read science fiction, but this was a great little novelette.  A precursor to the larger book, ""Rescuing the Future"", it is jam-packed full of sci-fi terms that a techie person would love:  holovid, gelpaks, Q-drive, and MHD fission drive, to name just a few.  The humor with which Mr. Miskell writes makes all that science stuff palatable to non-techies, too.  We have a little romance in there as well, which always makes for an interesting read.  Something for practically everyone.Mr. Miskell has a wonderful gift for storytelling, and for helping the reader get into the minds of his characters.  The story flowed well, and was a very enjoyable escape into the wilds of space.It came as a pleasant surprise that, even with its brevity, ""Godspeed Inc."" made a complete story on its own.  In fact, I didn't realize it was a lead-in to a larger book until I came to the end of it.  I hadn't read a synopsis, and didn't know what to expect.  So, even more fascinating adventure awaits!Now that I've read this, it only follows that I will be reading ""Rescuing the Future"" as well.  And I hope Mr. Miskell has more Naomi Kinder adventures up his sleeve.",5

B00FI1S9Y0,A3LJ6YVVQZBN5L,"06 16, 2014",FGold,Dawn At Last - Unique & Refreshing Read!,"I'll start by saying that I found this story to be intriguing, funny at times and most of all page turning.  Had a hard time putting this one down.  Mr Grodecki found a way to intertwine characters in a way in which I would never have anticipated.This story takes many twists and turns within the lives of these characters and most predominately Donna.  I really took to her from the beginning and as the story unfolded I found myself still loving her even though she could be raw.  I wanted to know why she felt the way she did....why she seemed cold in many ways, and why she wasn't with specific people in her life.  The author developed this character in a way that blended within the lives of the others but kept her at the forefront.The way this story intertwined between the characters was unique.  I wasn't expecting many of the connections throughout the storyline but they all came together in a way that makes the reader want to know all the details.  What brought each person to the other?  What circumstances landed them all in the same place?  All the details surrounding these people...you just have to know.I loved the analogy of how paint blends.  How &#34;careful rolling&#34; makes the streaks disappear.  It mirrors the characters.  Careful rolling or direction helps make their streaks (pasts) disappear....at least to each other.  The author's connections with people, humor, religion, morals and love come through in so many places and when you least expect it.I found myself asking questions while reading and re-reading passages.  There is a passage that says &#34;After a certain age there comes a point where it seems there is no more room for heartbreak&#34;.  I wondered if this was because the heart simply shuts down in that area to protect itself?  Maybe.  Or maybe the heart opens completely without reservation or preconceived notions about how things are supposed to be.Even though I can say that this story is indeed romantic, it seems to me that it is more of an exploration into those preconceived notions of what is right and wrong.  What is good and bad.  I've come to the conclusion that it depends on what a person experiences and sees in his/her own life that inevitably rule that course.  What I may view as perfectly normal, the next person may not.  Doesn't make either of us right or wrong.Mr. Grodecki has managed to question and propose questions throughout this novel.  This is what keeps the reader involved.  He managed to mix lives, sexual situations, and love between a group of people that you wouldn't ordinarily picture together.The art aspect of this story was refreshing.  Finding out at the end what it was all about and the outcome was delightful!  I think the author has found a way to interject art into a story that plays with each character in a different way.  Even the most un-artful of the group seemed to finally see past &#34;just the picture&#34; into the whole of the art.Mr. Grodecki has accomplished much with this novel.  He kept me entertained with a great story, added some humor which I always find to be a must have, some out of the ordinary sex scenes, and art.  He writes of &#34;an ongoing, unattainable fantasy&#34; and while I am not sure there is &#34;pure love&#34; out there in this world, he made me hopeful that there could be.",5

This is one author you should keep your eye on because she's going places. I love her stories so much that I could actually see her storylines turned into snippets in a movie.

Having read all of her work, this more than filled my expectations. From page one, I was captivated.  The characters fairly leap off the page. I loved the banter between Aurora and Lisa; they are so vivid and credible.  With Aurora off on honeymoon and Lisa holding the fort the sparks soon fly, blazing into a fire of suspense. Then there is the handsome Ham and the gorgeous Jeff. Ham has an incredible surprise, and I am not going to spoil it by explaining.  Another new character emerges and yet another, intriguing and absorbing the attention. The plot thickens quickly in this fast paced roller coaster of a read.  I had to force myself to put it down in the early hours of the morning. I couldn't wait to read the rest, so had an early night again reading into the night.

Something unknown happened to her in the past and she is still greatly affected by it. While she's trying to control her emotions about what happened in the past, she's dealing with some pretty harsh events that take place in Mercy. Throughout Mercy, Kate finds herself in a new position. Should she stick to her vanilla relationship with Tom or should she explore what BDSM and sex has to offer with Nick or Jaxon?I sped through Mercy and it pained me to put it down. I wanted to read through the next three parts of the book, but I'm pacing myself. We'll see how long that lasts... I love the BDSM elements in Mercy. Its not over the top. Kate is willing to dive into the lifestyle to help solve a murder. It helps that she's intrigued about being what it is like to be a sub. This novella was hot. Not just the sex scenes, but the descriptions of Kate's desires towards Nick and Jaxon. Yum! As for the thriller elements, I can't comment on that yet because it really wasn't focused on in Mercy. We know about the murder and how violent it was, but that's really it. I'm looking forward to how it plays out in the next installment.",5

Her plan is to find a cute and willing guy at a bar for a one night stand during her first night back in Alabama. She does not plan on it being her best friend's brother, the boy who tormented her early teen years.Told from alternating 1st person POV of Mia and Ben (whose their names could use some formatting when they start off a chapter), Where I Belong is a perfect blend of a cute story with some touches of humor, hot, hot love scenes, and a sweet developing romance. Mia and Ben have a lot of chemistry and it shows from their first encounter.  Ben must prove that he's not the same jerk he was as a teen, and Mia must get past how the comments Ben's former self made left her feeling.There are some cute twists with Ben's profession and his personal life. And the plot's climax at the end has just enough excitement without it being too much drama.One thing that I felt was over looked in the character development--what the heck did Mia and Tessa do for a living??? They were 23 so they should have been out of college for a year yet they acted like they were just on summer break.  There were some places where the characters seemed younger than they were supposed to be. I'm hoping the next book explains what the girls do for jobs when the summer ends.Still, it's a cute, well paced, feel-good story with no cheating, no cliffhanger, and a HEA.  I'm definitely interested in learning more about Tessa and Luke so I hope they get their book next. A very promising start to a new series.",5

B007MQDVLU,A2TXPTGF9JXIMF,"05 1, 2012",Kevin M. Hopson,An absolutely amazing short story!,"I only give a five-star rating if a work clearly blows me away, and this short story by LJ Holmes certainly qualifies. It's just as much a love story as it is a mystery, which means it has universal appeal. Take me, for example. I usually read dark fiction, science fiction, crime fiction, etc., so I had some doubts at first. However, I like to keep an open mind and venture outside my typical genres from time to time. In this case, I am glad I did. It's difficult to disclose much without giving away the story, as this is a mystery after all, but the build-up of suspense and anxiety was masterful. I felt as if I was in Jonathan's shoes throughout the entire story. Has his wife left him for another man? Has she been kidnapped? Is she involved in some sort of conspiracy? These are all questions the reader encounters. When the big reveal finally comes, it shocks you. Maybe others will see it coming, but I can honestly say I never did. We see despair and beauty at the same time. Thinking of my own wife while reading this story, I couldn't help but feel a variety of emotions. In fact, I haven't been this emotionally drawn to a story since reading Flowers for Algernon, and Holmes managed to do this in a much shorter work, which shows just how talented she is. I would recommend this book to ANYONE, regardless of what they typically read. If you're human, you will enjoy it. It's that simple.",5

Elizabeth Finn's books just get better and better and I may need to start stalking her for new books because she writes the best MEN!  She knows that the best kind of man is the bad boy that no one can get, until he falls for that one woman.  And oh, how hard I've fallen for Jordan...  My heart is aching just to know that the story is over and I can't see him anymore.The story starts with a virgin and a one-night stand.  I seem to have a special place in my heart for stories where the main character loses her virginity in a completely unexpected way to a man least likely to be offered the job because this is the second of Ms Finn's books where I've experienced this and I was hooked from line one!Adeline is out for a night of celebration after landing the internship of the century and she decides to step out of her comfort zone with an uber hot older man she meets at the bar without even knowing his name.  Fast forward two days and who do you think she stumbles into at her new internship? You guessed it, Mr. One Night Stand himself.  But it's not just the dynamic of the off-limits restoration principal and the intern, though that in and of itself was steamy and angsty and everything I like.  It's the way Elizabeth Finn writes - her characters say the kind of things you want to highlight and underline and come back to read over and over!  It's the way I become so obsessed with her characters that I'm pulling out my kindle at every red light so I can read just one more sentence!  It's also the fact that the author writes all this without making you want to jump up and down and yell at the main characters or hit them over the head, not even once!If I haven't made it clear, RESTORING JORDAN is a MUST read - it's romantic and beautiful and everything I could have hoped for and so much more!  It has a phenomenal storyline, well carved out characters, and the perfect love story that makes you jealous and excited all at once.Reviewed by preppeafor TheRomanceReviews.com",5

Who doesn't like a tortured hero, especially the one with a little daughter whom he adores?A SOLDIER'S PROMISE is another installment in Crystal Lake Series, and it made me wish I could visit it. Besides beauty of the lake, small-town values and kind-hearted people drew me to this place. People like ER nurse Julie Crain.Julie is recovering from a broken engagement, and the last thing she needs is to risk her heart again. But that's exactly what happens when she offers her place to stay to newcomers in town and ER patients - handsome single dad Derek Ryerson and his daughter Lexi. But how can she not help them when hotels have no vacancies and he needs to recover from a car accident?Derek faces his own moral dilemma. He loves Lexi with all his heart and will do anything to protect her from things - and people - that might hurt her. But does he really knows what's best for her? Strong and kind, he is still running away from what he thinks threatens Lexi. He also runs away from faith. Julie is an amazing heroine. Not only she helps his physical wounds heal, she is determined to do the same with his spiritual and emotional ones. Even when she is falling for him while knowing he just passes through town.Will Derek's secret tear them apart? Or will Julie help him believe again - and save him and the happiness of his little daughter? The answers are in A SOLDIER'S PROMISE. I loved the theme of self-sacrifice, and the bond between father and daughter was very touching. It is a beautiful, kind, and tender story, and I can't wait for the next book in Crystal Lake Series to be out.",5

It was such a funny read that it hooked me almost immediately. The result is that I have read it in three sittings. A romantic story with a very satirical and ironical tone, this story will make you laugh out loud (I did), go ""awww"", and even feel a bit sad. It has everything any reader would ask for in a book. The author keeps you hooked to his words by using the language in a very intelligent way, making literary, musical, and film references that are easily recognised by the reader. He has a very cool way of talking to the reader, so you feel like you are close to the events that are developing before your eyes.When Robb hopped on the bus who would take him back to Canada, he wasn't expecting to meet someone that would change his life somehow. Meeting a girl who he will call Gertrude will turn the bus trip into something much more interesting, and will provide a lot of material to the book he was intending to write during the long journey. The book we can enjoy now. Follow Robb and Gertrude in this hilarious, romantic, ironic, emotional at times journey and you won't be disappointed.The side characters that will appear along the story are well depicted and show the great skill this author has for creating memorable and realistic characters that will stay in your mind long after finishing the book. I didn't find any bad thing about this book, apart from some harmless typos and some too repetitive expressions.I definitely recommend this book as the perfect weekend read. One of the best books I have read this year so far.",5

But after finishing it and reading 3 other books since, I can't seem to get this story off my mind! At first I didn't like it as much as the first book, The Token, but after endless thought, I think it deserves 5 stars. Marata Eros is proving to us once again how good her writing truly is. To have made me feel happy, heart broken, angry, devastated, scared, pensive and mortified all in under 20,000 words, is quite a skill!I tried to put myself in the main character, Faren's, situation to see what I would do. Her situation being: terminally ill with only months to live, having the financial burden of her ill mother's care- even after she herself is gone, going to extremes to make the extra cash required with the little time she has left...and so her plight goes on; I really don't think I'd do much different! Desperate times call for desperate measures.Jarred 'Mick' McKenna is the gorgeous self-made billionaire who wants to sweep the prideful Faren off her feet. But she's playing hard to get because of her dire circumstances. This is what I'm struggling the most with. I just want her to let go and give in to him and spill her guts to take the burden off her shoulder!!! I'm hopeful this will happen in time but patience isn't a strength of mine! LolWe're left hanging with another cliff hanger but luckily the next instalment will be out in no time.I am thoroughly enjoying The Token series, Marata Eros is a killer New Adult Author who's skills just keep growing-even when you think she's already got them all!The emotions that the story makes you feel are diverse.

I have met quite a few persons with this problem and when you are with them all you can think about is how they can be helped. To say life for them is not easy is an understatement. When I began reading this book I realized that there are ways to help persons who are troubled with this condition and it gave me hope. I read it all through and I must say I was impressed by the depth of knowledge and understanding the author has shown on the subject. There were things there that I had not known before and it helped me understand better what the disorder was. The steps are very interesting and I have tried a few on some friends of mine who have the disorder and surprisingly they responded well to them. I have not tried everything as yet but I feel it is best to ease into it. This book can be a great help if used in the correct way.

B00ALLQW5A,A1IVBDLAO9MP4A,"12 25, 2012",Grampy,Short but Powerful Survival Guide for Life,"""Trusting God When Bad Things Happen"" by Shelley Hitz is not a long book, but it has great potential to be a life-changing book. Calling on her own experiences of bad things happening, and how she learned to cope with tragedies by growing in her faith in God, Shelley has written a virtual cookbook on learning to trust in God and lean on Jesus. No one can read about her experiences and think ""that wasn't as bad as what I've gone through"" or ""maybe that works for her, but it won't work for me"". She has written a book that is 100% biblical in its truths, and firmly founded on faith in God as her co-author. Shelley has a special place in her heart and soul for the trials and tribulations of teen girls, but the precepts in this book are by no means limited to just teen girls. Quite to the contrary, this short book is packed with a powerful message for everyone who faces uncertainty when ""bad things happen"".It's not exactly unheard of that bad things happen. Look at today's newspaper, and you will find ample evidence that something bad happened to a lot of people just since yesterday's newspaper came out. If nothing bad has ever happened to you, reading this book will help to prepare you for that inevitable day when something bad will happen to you. If your life has been stricken by tragedy beyond your comprehension, reading this book will give you the tools and even the motivation to face and overcome that tragedy, whether or not you believe it possible to ever get through your situation. This book is a must-read for everybody. It won't take much of your time, it won't hurt you, and it will help you immensely if you keep your heart and mind open to its teachings.I was given a free copy of this book by the author, in exchange for an honest and impartial review. I am grateful for the opportunity to read this excellent book.",5

Adamak ""Joan  Adamak, Author and Book...",A State of Consciousness Can Open Up the Entire World,"John Hydon, Ph.D. was a scientist who studied the stars and the planets from a specially built site in the Yukon of Canada.  When Dr. Hydon and his first wife, Margaret, parted ways, she left him with a small son, known as J.J.  Thereafter he married a lovely woman, Heidi whom he loved with all his heart, and she died in childbirth when she bore a daughter, also named Heidi, but the child called herself Hey.  After Heidi died, for three years John ignored his children, believing that his sole purpose was to search the heavens.  As a result, Hey entered vibrations not of Earth that she called Enigma, where she saw her mother and she could mentally and emotionally conjure up anything she wanted.Eventually John realized his neglect of his children, and spent time with them, especially Hey, who was more receptive than JJ.  As JJ grew into a teenager and attended a good university run by the Jesuits, he developed within himself a purpose to do something to irritate the head Jesuit and he started up a religious order by the Internet, promoting what he believed religions should be, and taking all of the donations he received and spent them on charitable foundations.  He became a real organizer and the only person he truly listened to was his sister Hey. Both children were aware that there was a strong affection between them, but kept it safe.After studying the heavens for decades, Canada and the US joined forces in going to the moon and settling it, perhaps with the idea of one day settling Mars.  As with all of Stan's books, there is much science, mysticism, philosophy and romance sprinkled throughout the book.  Actually the story points the way as to how to bring a type of Utopia to Earth.

I want to know where I can find my very own lion. Ms. Pryce can write some sexy vampires but I think that Dante just might exceed them in sexy points and not just because he's hot.In Dark Innocence we find Hannah not coping well with life post-Lizbeth&#8217;s abduction. She's trying to numb herself with alcohol, drugs, and sex. Unfortunately her eidetic memory makes any reprieve short and her actions just add another guilt-laden memory to her suffering. Fortunately she is able to call Dante to help her out of her most recent predicament as they have remained in contact since he helped rescue her. That Dante is the only person in her life who knows the depths to which she has sunk, yet still comes to her aid when she calls only adds to the feeling of safety his presence instills in Hannah. It is the manner in which he handles Hannah that increases his hotness quotient exponentially. He is gentle with her when she needs it but is not afraid to deal out a little tough love and it is this tough love that helps her to get her life back under control - no more alcohol, no more drugs, no more men ... well, only one man. May I say that I loved Hannah's attempted seduction? I would still be laughing were it not for the nail-biting situation Hannah found herself in immediately afterwards.As the danger Hannah faces intensifies she finds herself under Dante's protection and, even more importantly, under Dante! Thank you Ms. Pryce for making Dante a lion shifter! Everyone knows that cats love their cream and Dante is no exception ... oh my that man sure made my kitty purr. I appreciated that Dante spent so much time being intimate with Hannah, engaging in some serious foreplay, and made sure she was ready before they finally went all the way - and you'll have to read the book to know exactly what I'm referring to.As with Dark Cravings, there is a lot of action as Hannah finds herself the target of a stalker. And despite the fact that she has been sheltered from the dark side of the world by her family for much of her life, with Dante's help, she finds her inner strength and proves that she has Grey blood running through her veins too. Again Ms. Pryce writes with just the right balance of erotica and paranormal romance. I'm looking forward to reading Dark Secrets next.~ Wicked Reads Review Team ~",5

B00CY35D8A,A2Z3IXZ17E88J4,"08 1, 2013","James Tepper ""&#34;Are we there yet&#34;""",Outstandiing final chapter of an excellent serialized novel,"First Bird:Episode 3 is the closing section to a serialized novel by Greig Beck, published in 3 parts, released on June 1, July 1 and August 1, 2013.  Beck is simply getting better and better.  Each part must be read, in sequence, to get the full benefit. It's really all one single novel, broken up into 3 pieces.  But each piece is different, and each is thrilling.The ending is a real corker.  I don't want to reveal too much, especially about the final few pages which upped my already very high esteem for Beck's plotting another few notches.  Suffice it to say that the plague introduced in Episode 1, and its source and method of control introduced in Episode 2, both come home to a US in total chaos in Episode 3.  There are stark, disturbing and gripping scenes, reminiscent of images from ""Swan Song"" and ""The Stand"", but written in an extremely succinct style that permeate this last episode.  The action is non-stop, and although the shortest of the 3 sections, I think this is the most terrifying.  The ending is simply brilliant, and not what you will expect.  That's all I've got to say, although I may post a more detailed comment with some spoilers in a day or two after I've thought about it a bit more.Greig Beck now has a string of some 5 or 8 hit novels (depending on how one counts them), and not a dud among them. He is a force to be reckoned with, and someone whose work I hope to enjoy for many years to come.Very Highly Recommended.J.M. Tepper",5

B005DPIINI,A2I2Y9PAHC892E,"02 15, 2012",Bexter29,"Fallen Eden, Book Two","Great second book to series.  Brynn and William are so in love, yet so frustrated since their Alliance won't grant them a betrothal.  William keeps trying to convince Brynn to elope/run away with him, but she refuses since she's scared the Alliance will hunt them down and hurt William.  John Townsend's alliance attacks Patrick and Brynn. As Brynn tries to save herself and Patrick, she inadvertently almost kills William with her uncontrolled powers.  Brynn leaves William, letting him assume that she's left him for someone else, and tries to start a new life in Paris.  Her alliance tracks her down and informs her she's too dangerous and powerful to defect so she will have to resume training with Patrick to try and learn how to control her powers.This story is packed with action as John Townsend's alliance is relentless in attacking Brynn.  Paul re-enters the story with Brynn desperate for a friend.  Patrick is pretty hostile toward Brynn since she broke his brother's heart.  It doesn't help matters when she begs Patrick to ask the alliance to save Paul's life.  It's frustrating to see William and Brynn apart due to misconceptions and false beliefs, but I'm glad they resolve their issues in Fallen Eden.  William approaches his father again with a betrothal request and Charles makes a promise that he will allow Brynn to be engaged to a Hayward.  The author eludes to the possibility that the Hayward could be Patrick or William so we're left guessing until United Eden.  Couldn't wait to finish the series.  I thought the pacing of Fallen Eden was even better than the first book and would highly recommend the series.",5

I don't think any of us have.&#34; He grinned and stood, taking her hand. &#34;He's careful about it. If you asked, though, I have a feeling he'd show you in a heartbeat.&#34; He's also so sweet and considerate where his mate is concerned, &#34;Jace held back a curse at the thought it was him causing her hurt. Damn it. There was only one way for Nadie to find her paranormal, thereby relieving her pain, and that was to create a bond through mating.&#34; When Dante, Jace and Nadie are together it sure makes up for one naughty good time, &#34;Dante was on her in a flash, and she gasped as, suddenly, she was on his lap and he was sitting where she'd been just a moment before. Jace had moved as well, sliding so he was thigh to thigh with Dante. The dragon had his hands on her face, the bear, his hand on her hip.&#34; Dante he's also considerate of Nadie which I think is really sweet and hot in a guy, &#34;you're effing amazing, Nadie. I should have been telling you since the day I met you how much I want you. And I see your eyes on my c***. You want me to take out my piercing? It'll feel really effing good when we're making love, but since this is your first time, I don't want to have that as an added pressure.&#34; Jace is the really naughty one in this relationship, &#34;I'll come down your throat next, baby.

This latest book is a little gem and once again brings out his innate understanding of the human condition.  For anyone that has lost someone to drugs, has known a peculiar relative, is a pet owner, had a childhood crush or has suffered from depression then this book will touch your heart. The final short story ""Afternoons with Angela"" brought a lump to my throat and tears to my eyes.

Kaz is a closeted and inexperienced gay man who inherited his brothel from the father who did his best to beat his sexual preferences out of him. Only after his father's death did he turn the business into Spice `n' Solace, the premier all-male brothel in the Galactic Alliance. Kaz has found professional success, but he hasn't yet found freedom from the memory of his father's brutal lesson or from the small minded brutes he must deal with running a brothel on Elora Ki.  Kaz is a complicated fellow and it is a testament to the skill of the author that all the parts of his life and personality come together to create a fascinating and convincing hero.The second hero of the story is Jathan One-Moon, a skilled negotiator burdened with renegotiating the intergalactic peace treaty each year. It is up to Jathan to prevent all out war, a task he can't escape and can only pass on to a biological child. The aliens refuse to negotiate with anyone else. The stress of this monumental task turns him to Spice `n' Solace each year for the duration of the negotiations.  He longs for a mate, a long term lover, but since that hasn't seemed within reach, the professional male escorts of the exclusive brothel have become his personal coping strategy.These two men are brought together when a blatant attempt to undermine Kaz's business leads to a lock down of the brothel on the very day Jathan's annual visit to Elora Ki for the negotiations begins. With all of his escorts quarantined, Kaz decides to visit Jathan in person to explain and hopefully salvage the long time business arrangement. They've never actually met so it is easy to understand that Jathan mistakes Kaz for the escort he is expecting. The surprise is that Kaz is swamped by the desire to be exactly what Jathan needs. It is pure fireworks from that moment forward--until the plot to undermine Kaz's business turns personal, putting Kaz and his relationship with Jathan at risk.What I loved about Kaz: Kaz is a delightful mix of worldly, smart and still very innocent about his own needs. He can handle himself in a fight and is passionate about changing the world around him.  He is the brothel owner with the heart of gold.What I loved about Jathan: Jathan is a man with heavy responsibilities. He is good at what he does and is used to taking what he needs on a personal level, but he takes nothing for granted. He doesn't abuse his position and he respects and values Kaz, even thinking he is a paid escort.Overall, the book is a fast, captivating read. The characters are unforgettable and the world is well drawn from the mean streets to the alien negotiations.",5

B008LDYW2K,A2AAAZKAJ9KHHG,"12 15, 2012","Beagle Book Space ""Michelle""",A Great Debut Novel,"For a debut novel, Chalk Valley is exceptionally well written and very fast moving all the while keeping the reader interested and fascinated at the same time.The story is told from several points of view which gives the reader a great overview of every facet that is going on, especially since you get to see the criminal's side of things as well. I really enjoyed this angle as it's not often you get to read a crime novel which shows you behind the scenes of the killer's world, normally you just get the point of view of the investigator or police officers involved and don't really get told much about the culprit until the end when they discover who it is.There was also a lot of outlining of police procedures and the subsequent red-tape involved in an investigation in this novel which made it seem a lot more realistic. It wasn't your typical perfect 'Law & Order' crime where all the evidence matches up too perfectly and the criminal is caught within a week. There was a lot of waiting and lagging of time before many developments eventuated which I quite enjoyed as it made the story all the more real and interesting.You could definitely tell an awful lot of research and time has been put in by the author to replicate how a proper investigation can go down and this effort certainly shows.My favourite thing about this story was just how real and flawed all of the characters were. You really got a sense of who they were and felt for them through their struggles and frustrations throughout the novel.Overall, Chalk Valley is probably one of the best crime novels I have read in a very long time. At no point was I bored with the story, in fact it was usually the opposite where I was disappointed if I was too tired or didn't have the opportunity to continue reading it for whatever reason. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this novel to anyone interested in stories of this nature and look forward to reading more from this author in the future.",5

You will feel so many emotions. You will laugh your butt off, there are some seriously hilarious bouts, acts, encounters, conversations; you&#8217;ll seriously laugh out loud! You will feel the angst between the characters and the situations that they find themselves in, you will also cry because of the situations and feelings of the heroine, Tia.So, the hero, Reign has been out of a 7-year long relationship with Selena, the woman he still believes that he loves. He&#8217;s a wealthy club-owner and entrepreneur. But he&#8217;s also hot, single and a bear to be around. He needs to get laid, but doesn&#8217;t want to have to actually put any effort into it and doesn&#8217;t want to have to socialize.Enter Tia, who thinks that Reign could definitely work for a one-night stand, but has no way of keeping her mouth shut. Their first encounter is hilarious and snarky. Afterwards, Reign knows how easy getting laid could be if he had a wingman. So, he hires Tia as his wingwoman. They have a good friendship as well as a working relationship. She helps him pick-up bedmates, works to make his ex-girlfriend/fianc&eacute;e jealous and is also a part-time accountant for him.But the lines get blurred, as they sometimes will, and both Reign and Tia have growing feelings for each other, which also confuses them both. It is confusing for Tia, because she has been filling Reign&#8217;s bed with different women for 6 months and he is her employer and friend. It&#8217;s confusing for Reign, because he has been so in love with Selena & preoccupied with making her jealous and getting her back, that he can&#8217;t fathom having actual feelings for another woman.When Reign doesn&#8217;t know if he can choose between Tia and Selena, or if he wants to, hearts and spirits start to break. The hidden, true characteristics start to become well-known to everyone, except Reign. He is stuck in the past and has blinders on. Reign know it and as much as he doesn&#8217;t want to, he is hurting Tia. He is just terribly confused and his mind is muddled between a woman that he loved for 7 years and planned a life with and a best friend, who has turned into so much more.We also get to see glimpses of the MC Sinners guys and even their old ladies. I just love those characters and loved their appearance in this book as well. I&#8217;ve never been ready to let them go after their books were finished.

Sparrow, the word strange comes up quite a bit. Strange and dark. I would add to that odd and weird. But odd, weird, strange, and dark in the best sense.This is a really good story. It is hard to get your fingers wrapped around it, though. Lethe is the River of Forgetfulness, from which the dead drink to forget their earthly lives so that they may reincarnate. When the main character, Dan, washes ashore he has not forgotten his prior life, but he is lost, confused and disoriented.I think the thing that is hard to pin down about this book is that the world Dan wakes up to is rather abstract, and yet that abstractness has been captured in detail and specificity. There is a lot of wandering in this book, and it slips into sci-fi with entities living/existing in cells and membranes. But that doesn't define the story either. Because it is balanced with concrete passages about Dan's life prior to his arrival in Lethe. Or wherever it is he actually is.This is one of those undiscovered gems. I haven't read a lot of Ursula LeGuin but it makes me think of the Lathe of Heaven. Perhaps, better done.I do like the other main character Marco Sabonis. I liked the ending a lot because the story doesn't go where you think it will go. Not every loose end is cauterized, but you get a nice sense of Ahh...good story.It makes your eye twinkle, because it's rather clever. I read it in about twenty-four hours.

I know this author under a different pen-name than her more adult titles:  I was excited to read the first in her new writing adventure.  I have a great admiration for her work for the 18+ group, and she has not disappointed in this YA work.Yseult has managed to transition her skills for crafting relationships that are believable and emotional, with a definition and clarity that is rare in many books geared to this market.

Of course, there are more chapters in this story yet to be written: the author left us with plenty of questions and a huge `what next' that will keep readers hungry for the next installment.A perfect starter for this series, with intrigue and crafting that will capture the imagination of readers both young and old.I received an eBook copy from the author for purpose of honest review.

B003NUQOW2,A3KOWKCU9ZDGYO,"10 2, 2011",Gordon Ryan,A Fine Study in Human Nature,"Author Rebecca Forster always turns out more than expected, especially in her character development. Some of the characters are shallow (in fact, not in literary terms) and some are more complex, but Forster continues to amaze me (this is my fifth of her novels) with her understanding of human nature and how it moves people to action.In this driving legal thriller, she exposes the weak underbelly of human corruption even among those who are sworn to defend society and to prosecute those who violate the law. Using the literary medium of naivety in her primary character, she allows the story to develop so the reader can determine the right and wrong of the action. I particularly love her style of depicting daily actions, everyday chores that people do as they rise, eat, work, and play.Give Rebecca Forster a couple of hours of your time and you will add yet another excellent author to you list of favorites.Gordon Ryan",5

Sable and when I had the chance to get my hands on her new book An Imperfect Circle I didn&#8217;t just jump at it, I launched myself.  Karl and Elise are a little bit younger than most of the characters I read about but I loved meeting them in the With You series and couldn&#8217;t wait to hear their story.  Since they were so young I wasn&#8217;t sure what was going to happen to get me from when they met to what I knew of them as adults&#8230; and then I got to go on a journey with Elise and Karl that made me remember why I love this author so much!Elise Belrose has been through some brutal things in her short 16 years, but even when we first meet her she is trying to heal herself, get herself to a better place.  I know a lot of grown women that aren&#8217;t as strong as this young character that R.J. Sable has written and I think this is the type of story that can connect with a young girl who has gone through something earth shattering and help her realise it isn&#8217;t her fault and give her hope for the future.  This is the type of story that could give much needed strength of mind and spirit to young girls who have gone through something similar&#8230; I know it is just a book but I truly believe books have power and can make people brave.An Imperfect Circle didn&#8217;t skip over any of the hard parts of finding yourself again after going through difficult times&#8230; it takes the reader on the journey through pain and healing along with the characters.  I was smiling when they were and my heart broke right along with theirs (hello chapter 32, thank you for making me cry!).  Both Elise and Karl have terrible things happen in their lives and have to find a way to carry on and find people to lean on, although when the book starts Elise has no intention of leaning on anyone&#8230;&#8220;Don&#8217;t make friends.Don&#8217;t make any sentences longer than five words.Don&#8217;t smile.Don&#8217;t explain yourself.

I have to say that I had a hard time with Karl through the beginning of the With You series (not to mention his best friend Matt), but I have to say that after reading this book I may have fallen a little in love with him!The way Karl handles Elise and what she has gone through is nothing short of swoon worthy, he is mindful of what she has been through and only wants to make her feel safe and loved.&#8220;You&#8217;re perfect in your imperfection. You&#8217;re everything to me.&#8221; &#8211; Karl CarterI also love the fact that he is for sure an alpha male in the making.

Congratulations.&#8221; &#8211; Karl CarterI was so happy to get to see all the other Carter family members and be able to get a better feel for everything they had gone through.

Barbie ended up walking to the top of her apartment building and walking off the top to the concrete below where I stood playing.Every one of us has something that they fear and it never seems to leave us.

After the Civil War, the West found they had a shortage of women - while the East had a shortage of men.  The  men who went West figured out that if the West was going to become civilized, they needed women to help create the family style  life they were wanting.  Thus mail order businesses sprung up in the East.  There were  many different reasons  why women  signed  up to become mail order  brides - but the  one fact remains quite clear ... these women had backbone.... they had courage, above and beyond.

B00JFIW2ZE,A3S7REHVBOSTLR,"07 20, 2014",Toni V. Sweeney,A Milder View of Hell on Wheels,"If you&#8217;ve seen Hell on Wheels, you&#8217;ll recognize many of the places mentioned in this story.  Although it&#8217;s not as gritty and bloodthirsty as that series, Walls of the Wind still evokes the lawlessness and temporary nature of the lives of the people attached to building the railroad as well as the hardships under which they lived.  Kit&#8217;s straitlaced nature is balanced by Patrick&#8217;s easy-going attitude. He sees nothing wrong with running a saloon, as long as the men patronizing it obey the rules. Kit sees such a place as a den of lawlessness just waiting to explode into violence. Her problems with her &#8220;children,&#8221; specifically the two teenagers ready to step into adulthood are carefully detailed as are the concerns she has for the little brother and sister she&#8217;s determined to keep together.If I have any complaints about this novel, it&#8217;s that the unnamed gambler, the villain, doesn&#8217;t play a large enough part in the story, and his reason for his hatred of Patrick isn&#8217;t immediately explained.  There were also some grammatical and editing errors which should&#8217;ve been caught before publication&#8230;but that won&#8217;t spoil the story for the reader.There&#8217;s a great deal of description and historical fact in this story, both in the section taking place in New York, as well as on the trail through Nebraska and Colorado. This is  an enjoyable story, both for its historical significance as well as its sweet romance. If you like historical romances, you should enjoy Walls for the Wind.This novel was supplied by the publisher and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",5

B007DJK8G2,A1V0NFBX66BN4B,"08 28, 2013","Paul Bennett ""Scribo, ergo sum""",Exquisitely compelling,"By far most of the historical fiction that I read is full of the twang of many bowstrings and ballista, the thrust of gladius and spear, the tromping of hobnailed caligae, however at the behest of my Twitterverse friend SJA Turney and after reading her blog posts I finally succumbed and decided to read Gisborne Book of Pawns by Prue Batten.  A wise choice as it turned out.The author has given us a wonderful re-telling of the story of Sir Guy Gisborne and the Lady Ysabel of Moncrief.  The story is set during the beginning of Richard the Lionheart's reign.  It begins with the arrival of Gisborne in Aquitaine to escort Ysabel back to her home at Moncrief as her mother has died and her father is in dire straits.  This sets up one of the main story lines; the tension between Sir Guy and Lady Ysabel.  Other plots and sub plots are also evident bringing to the reader a sublime set of surprises and twists.  The two main characters are beset with emotions, Gisborne's arising from his past and his desire for his future and Ysabel's awakening  to reality.The turmoil of Ysabel's soul and the conflicts in her heart and mind are presented in such a way as to make it seem like Ysabel's thoughts seep through the pages and enters the hearts and minds of the readers.  This exquisitely compelling style of prose is what kept me entranced through the entire book. As an example I include this excerpt(no spoiler):I dared him - so help me as I gazed at that severe face, I dared him. And it seemed as though we clashed close in our duel, our hilts jamming, our breath dragging in and out. He shook off my weapon and felled me with one blow. `Yes,' he said.The supporting cast of characters are also fascinating from the redoubtable Lady Cecilia, the various nuns and priests to the main antagonists, Halsham and de Courcey.  I am now a fan of Prue Batten and heartily agree with another fan who once told me that she could write a phone book and make it compelling.  I look forward with great anticipation to the rest of these saga.  5 stars indeed.",5

Bring in hottie gym owner/ personal trainer Jake.  He seems to show interest in her and Sherry has tried to get her to pay him attention but she feels he is way too young.This story has a lot going on as you see and I barely touched the tip of the iceberg. It is faced paced and never leaves you feeling overwhelmed by all of it though.  I loved the way Kristy not only was struggling with a new life, but the age thing, and her friend Sherry's new lifestyle. There is lots of twists and turns and a lot of very hot sex. If you have been thinking about reading a book with some D's or Bdsm this one is a great place to start.I recommend this to anyone that likes very hot, erotic, contemporary romance, May/December relationships, Cougar, D's and BDSM.",5

I knew it involved time-travelling from the premise and I must admit, I did wonder whether I was going to like that aspect. Dr Who is about the only time-traveller I'll tolerate but, nonetheless, Hindsight intrigued me so I thought I'd give it a go. Well, I'm so glad I did. Not only is this book hilarious in places - and I mean laugh out loud on occasions, it also made me cry - I won't tell you when and why, you'll have to read it to find out. And it didn't just make me well up once, it did it twice - woah! Extremely well written, it deals with a lot of serious issues too - the idea that women can have it all in today's world, a hard-hitting career, a demanding family, time for herself (as if!) is challenged - at some point something's gotta give, but what? That's the dilemma modern-day Juliette faces, it takes a trip back in time to help her realise what's important in life and that there's such a thing as balance. With that trip back to the 1961, come other issues - people who should have been in modern-day Juliette's life, but for some reason aren't. Enough said on that already - I don't want to spoil any surprises and this book did surprise me. Like I said, I loved it.",5
B00HKMPG96,A2F8W9DY2LTMYA,"01 30, 2014",excellentwheels,: three days on one of the most unique islands Japan has to offer.,"Okinawa Island is a very interesting and unique island with a tumultuous history, particularly after World War II, when it was taken over as the American base of operations during and after World War II is led to a unique blend of American and Japanese culture. Okinawa is one of the few places in Japan, where it is possible to get an authentic Tex-Mex taco and Hawaiian seafood, while still being able to find traditional Japanese tea houses and sushi bars, all within a two block radius.The Miss Passport guide to Okinawa is the perfect three-day itinerary in lists everything from the best hotels within any given price range to the best and most interesting attractions. Each day of the itinerary will list a main attraction along with possible restaurants and nightclubs. The guidebook also has all of the most important information such as contact numbers for the hotels and restaurants to make reservations, but it goes one step further. I noticed that the guidebook even contains information on the Japanese bus system and public train system, as well as the best places to rent a car and even a bicycle, should I wish to tour the island while getting some exercise and as if all this information wasn't enough. The guidebook is also chock-full of interesting and intriguing facts about Japanese history and customs, it almost feels like there is a Japanese tour guide. Following me around to each of the places I'm going to visit, it is very a shine to note that the guidebook is written in plain easy to understand language, Celeste to avoid any unnecessary complications on the trip. I look forward to having one of the most memorable vacations possible and even now. It's going to be longer than three days. This itinerary is an excellent place to start, and I am sure Miss Passport will be an absolutely invaluable travel companion.",5

B00L5HCVLI,A3JQGAUYWLEQ5V,"07 17, 2014",Avid Reader,NO DOUBT INSTAREAD IS THE LEADER OF BOOK SUMMARIES,"I have no doubt that INSTAREAD is the leader in book summaries. This is my third summary that I have purchased from INSTAREAD. They have become my go to place in deciding which book I want to read next. INSTAREAD's 30-Minute summaries are a very detailed and in-depth summary of the complete story. They first give the reader an overall summary of the story, and then they go chapter to chapter to point out each of the important events of the story. If that was not enough, they also then highlight each of the characters in the story and explain who they are and what their relationship to each other is. INSTAREAD does this in a way that is not only informative for the reader, but also intrigues them into wanting to read the entire book. I have come to rely heavily on INSTAREAD's summaries to determine which book I want to read next. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND not only reading this summary, but reading each of INSTAREAD's summaries.",5
B00CQECA1K,AL0LTL9QRB3KY,"08 19, 2013",Farrah,Sweet and Steamy Werewolf Romance,"A hot and sweet werewolf romance! I loved this book. Logan & Jenna was a brilliant read, full of nonstop thrills and steamy romance.Jenna was a lovely heroine. She's easy to relate to and very likable. Though she might not have a lot of fairy magic, don't underestimate her. She could be downright formidable when she needed to be. I thought she was wonderful.Logan was just as amazing. He was super sweet and completely lovable. I loved how, as soon as he knew Jenna was his mate, he was completely devoted to her. He was just adorable. I thought he was perfect.The romance was well done. Both sweet and steamy, it was great. Sweet, because as soon as they knew they were mates, Logan and Jenna didn't hesitate about falling for each other. And steamy because these two couldn't keep their hands off each other.The plot was fast paced. There were definitely thrills to keep you on the edge of your seat as Jenna tried to get away from the wolf gang that wants to use her powers. I was hooked the entire way through and I really enjoyed the story. The ending was perfectly sweet and I loved it.Logan & Jenna was a fantastic paranormal romance. It had everything you could want in a werewolf romance and I loved it! Lovers of the genre, this is a book you definitely don't want to miss.*I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review",5

If you like it, read the book:""The only people who seemed to be really interested in sound were rock musicians and they talked knowingly about balance and mix and tremulous occupulation and autofellatio or whatever the hell it was, and they all nodded a lot as if it were art, and then they turned the volume up three times too high for human ears and took dope so that they didn't have to listen to it. It gave Trace a headache and he was getting one now.""",5
