# Predicting Product Review Sentiment Using Classification

The goal of this project is to build a classification machine learning (ML) pipeline in a web application to use as a tool to analyze the models to gain useful insights about model performance. Using trained classification models, build a ML application that predicts whether a product review is positive or negative.

* Build end-to-end regression pipeline using 1) multiple regression, 2) polynomial regression, and 3) ridge, and 4) lasso regression.
* Evaluate regression methods using standard metrics including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2).
* Develop a web application that walks users through steps of the regression pipeline and provide tools to analyze multiple methods across multiple metrics.

# Amazon Products Dataset

Millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website. This makes Amazon Customer Reviews a rich source of information for academic researchers in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and machine learning (ML), amongst others. Specifically, this dataset was constructed to represent a sample of customer evaluations and opinions, variation in the perception of a product across geographical regions, and promotional intent or bias in reviews. There are many features, but the <b>important</b> features include:
* name: name of Amazon product	
* reviews.text: text in review	
* reviews.title: title of reviews
